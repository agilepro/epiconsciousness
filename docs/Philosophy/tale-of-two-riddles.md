#  A Tale of Two Riddles

**Copyright 2016 by Michael J. O’Neill**

This is a true story  about two very old and very odd riddles, and in this way the two riddles are related and how we might gain some insight into _free will_ and _determinism_.

## Introduction

Dear Friends,

This is an experiment in writing.

Please peruse the following, which is  
my soon-to-be-unpublished book.

This is an experiment in communication  
on several levels at once.

It’s an attempt at communicating  
a most complicated and difficult idea  
involving the conscious human will.

Despite this topic’s great difficulty,  
free will itself is a common everyday topic  
of thought, conversation, and study.

Though used every day in common life,  
the human will remains a mystery as to how it can work.

I’m testing here the understandability of a new perspective  
that seems to solve the free will mystery.

\*\*\*

A rare format is being used  
that looks like poetry,  
but is not.

This is a format experiment.

\*\*\*

There are six Episodes in this adventure.

## Episode 001 -A Tale of Two Riddles

Very Different Riddles
----------------------

This is a true story  
about two very old  
and very odd riddles,  
and in this way  
the two riddles are related.

But in many other ways  
they are very, very different.

The first riddle is most trivial,  
and the second is most profound.

The first riddle is too silly,  
the second too serious.

The first riddle is just innocent child’s play.  
The second threatens to toy with our minds.

Solving one seems  
almost unworthy of our effort;  
almost unworthy of its solution  
the other can make us feel.

Two rival riddles:  
one pointless, one hopeless.

The solution to the first riddle  
would be worthless;  
to the second, priceless.

There’s a pattern here.

The first riddle is merely an idle curiosity,  
the second is steeped in cultural impact.

—-  
The first is so trivial  
it can elicit responses like mild anger,  
derision, and jeering laughter.

The second is so profound  
it can elicit responses of mild despair,  
of being overwhelmed, and a wistful laugh.

The insignificant riddle is anchored  
at the simple end of everyday experience,  
while the significant riddle floats a little beyond  
the unfinished frontier of modern science.

\*\*\*

I’m not speaking metaphorically here.  
These are two down-to-earth,  
well known riddles.

I’ll briefly state them now,  
but a great deal of detail  
is poised for later printing.

The trivial riddle is:

**How can a mirror reverse left and right,**  
**but not up and down?**

The profound riddle is:

**How can we have a free will**  
**in the face of microscopic determinism?**

The reason for this discussion  
is a very recent discovery  
and a very surprising discovery  
that the trivial riddle  
unlocks the profound riddle.

What I mean by “unlocks”  
is that when the two riddles  
are looked at in just the right way,  
they can be seen  
to have a common form.

The free will riddle’s solution  
can then be seen  
to have the same form  
as the mirror riddle’s solution.

What this means is that  
the profound riddle  
can be understood  
by first learning  
to understand  
the trivial riddle.

There’s a lot to talk about here.

\*\*\*

But first,  
a few notes on the format I’m using.  
It looks a little like poetry,  
but it’s not.

I’m breaking these lines up according to ideas. This is because the  
discussion around these two riddles can get very complicated, so  
formatting it this way makes each individual idea easier to digest. I  
got this idea from a brilliant lady named Lillian Lieber, who pioneered  
it back in the 1930’s. See how much harder this paragraph is to read  
than all that proceeded? This format helps me write complicated ideas,  
and I hope it helps you understand them. Lillian Lieber wrote some of  
the most complicated books in the world in this poetry-like format,  
dealing with the very deepest topics in Mathematics and Physics, and  
they are still in print today.

Now watch this:

Go Google her  
and get impressed.

\*\*\*

Now back to my story:

These two simple sounding riddles  
are an entry point  
to some very deep thinking,  
and it’s fun to have a chance  
to see them fit together.

I’ve been playing with these two riddles  
for almost fifty years now,  
and I’m not bored yet.

At the start  
I had no idea the two riddles  
were in any way related.

I was simply fascinated by both,  
and finally lived to see  
them both fully solved.

The mirror riddle got solved fast,  
like in about five years,  
but I couldn’t explain it well,  
in a clear, convincing way.

The next forty years  
with the mirror riddle  
were spent in perfecting  
and refining the answer  
so that anyone could grasp it.

That was forty years of  
deeper and deeper insights  
as to what was going on with mirrors,  
and with people looking at mirrors,  
and with people theorizing about mirrors.

The mirror riddle,  
and it’s constantly improving explanation  
proved to be  
a very effective conversation starter,  
and a great way to meet people,  
especially in bars decorated with mirrors.

\*\*\*

The free will riddle  
went entirely different.

I was totally stumped.

My puzzling over how  
we can have free will  
in spite of determinism  
was totally bogged down  
for the first twenty-five years  
in several fascinating  
and learning-filled  
dead ends.

For free will I had no answers,  
no conversation starters,  
and a depleting hope  
that an answer was even possible.

Then,  
after a series of major adjustments,  
there was a very recent breakthrough.

So,  
now I finally have a  
conversation starter  
for free will.

You’re reading it.

After privately communicating  
all this with some friends,  
I’ve been encouraged  
to write it up for all.

\*\*\*

## Episode 002 -A Tale of Two Riddles

Very Related Riddles
--------------------

The trivial riddle is:

**How can a mirror reverse left and right,**  
**but not up and down?**

The profound riddle is:

**How can we have a free will**  
**in the face of microscopic determinism?**

After seeing, in Episode 001,  
how much the two riddles  
are opposed to each other,

now please hear  
how much they are also similar.

In spite of their deep differences,  
the two riddles are none-the-less related,  
and in some very, very  
interesting ways.

If,  
as previously noted,  
the trivial riddle will unlock  
the profound riddle,  
that, in itself, would put them  
into a deep relationship.

There are many more ways  
the two riddles are similar.

Nobel laureates  
have wrestled with both.

Neither riddle was EVER answered  
to my satisfaction  
by anyone.

Both riddles are clean and neat,  
yet the standard answers to both  
are never clean and neat.

Both can be over-explained by scholars  
with a blinding blizzard of facts and figures.

Both riddles look easy at first;  
but both prove to be very, very  
hard nuts to totally crack.

Both riddles can be delicious,  
but with vastly differing flavors.

Both riddles are unlikely  
to ever attract much  
research grant money.

No scientific theory needs  
either one of them solved,  
in order to make sense.

No machinery needs  
either one of them solved  
in order to function.

Both riddles can induce  
a mini cognitive dissonance  
when deeply pondered.

Both riddles  
maintain their mystery  
not long after  
the best of explanations  
are offered.

Both are pretty pure enigmas,  
And, I am told,  
have been around for centuries!

Both seem extremely intriguing  
to a significant swath of the population.

Most people can understand both riddles,  
and nearly everyone can say of them both,  
“Hey! There’s something very odd here.”

A goal of this discussion  
is to clearly see  
the clean and neat solution,

and just exactly how  
the trivial riddle unlocks  
the profound riddle.

\*\*\*

Just in case this unlocking  
doesn’t sound shocking enough  
(it really should sound shocking),  
let me say it a little more explicitly:

the mirror riddle unlocks  
the free will riddle.

This is a huge claim to make.

A short time ago  
I would have thought it to be  
a ridiculous claim.

It still often looks ludicrous to me,  
but when I review the discoveries  
and think it all through again  
(as it is slowly being printed here)  
it makes sense again.

Here is an alternate view  
that can soften the incredulity,  
and take off a few sharp edges:

the simple riddle unlocks  
the complex riddle.

That looks like  
a more workable idea.

It will all fit together soon,  
so please hang in here  
with me a while,  
as I set up more of the proof.

Both riddles require  
a special kind of thinking  
in order to be solved.

It’s not difficult thinking,  
just rarely attempted thinking.

But it’s easy thinking when  
someone shows you  
how and why.

\*\*\*

So far,  
since this solution is  
a very recent development,  
the best way I know to explain all this  
is to re-trace my steps  
as I first saw it.

After doing this,  
and after getting feedback from others,  
the explanation can then likely be  
spiffed up and shortened.

An easy, clean and neat,  
one page summary  
of the mirror solution  
can be seen at: [mirror\_reversal\_problem.html](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/mirror_reversal_problem.html)

A full treatment  
of the mirror solution  
can be seen at :

The clean and neat answer  
to the free will riddle  
is in development here.

## Episode 003 -A Tale of Two Riddles

Determinism?
------------

So, what the heck is determinism?

Determinism determines what happens.

Atoms are blind and mindless.

There are no  
free will decisions made  
at the low level of atoms,  
according to the best of science.

And this is a very good thing.

From this blind obedience of atoms  
we get a stable and predictable world.

Without determinism  
bossing atoms around,  
tables would not be solid  
and water would not be splashy.

Without determinism  
your phone would not work.

Nothing at all  
would work right.

Without determinism  
operating at the lower levels,  
Annie couldn’t guarantee that  
the sun would come out tomorrow.

So we all should love determinism,  
those of us who like  
to eat every day.

And scientists love it even more.  
It makes their work possible,  
and they make our lives better.

Sure camping is fun,  
but only if  
you can come home.

With the possible exceptions  
of mad scientists and evil scientists,  
we do pretty well  
because of science.

When you get right down to it,  
your auto mechanic is a scientist,  
your hair stylist is a scientist,  
and so are a huge number of others  
in your life.

At the lower levels,  
down in the biology level,  
and chemistry level,  
and atomic level,  
determinism is a very useful thing.

Determinism is a name for  
the ability of science  
to sometimes predict  
what is going to happen.

Because of determinism  
both nature and science  
are never whimsical,  
and always consistent.

\*\*\*

Determinism looks real good  
in the lower levels  
but up here at the top level,  
it seems to be a problem.

The same way  
it can push atoms around  
it seems that  
it can push US around also!

And who wants to get pushed around?

So determinism is a friend  
when it’s confined to the lower levels  
of mindless atoms and cells,

but up here at our level  
it’s an enemy  
that not only threatens  
to bend our wills and desires,  
it even presents an existential threat to us.

The big riddle is:

**How can we have a free will**  
**in the face of microscopic determinism?**

If determinism threatens  
the reality of our will  
down to the details  
of what we WILL TO THINK next,  
then what’s left to be us?

Are we just wet robots?

In a nutshell,  
the determinism vs. free will riddle is:

Who’s driving the bus,  
you or your atoms?

We could move up a level,  
to huge biological molecules,  
but they are just as mindless  
as the atoms that make them up.

Up another level to brain cells,  
and we might ask  
what is the IQ  
of one of our brain cells?

Mosquito brains of many cells  
are probably a lot smarter  
than any one human brain cell.

At every level below  
our top level of free will  
our microscopic parts  
(all of them, all the time)  
blindly and accurately follow  
laws of Biology,  
laws of Chemistry,  
laws of Physics.

Atoms determine molecular behavior,  
molecules determine nerve cell behavior,  
nerve cells determine the muscle cell behavior,

Oops!

I thought WE were the ones  
determining our own muscle behavior!  
Where does OUR behavior come in?

We ran out of parts,  
and lost free will  
in the process.

So,  
who IS driving the bus,  
you or your brain cells?  
you or your molecules?  
you or your atoms?  
you or your … ?

Determinism comes from  
a crisp, clear, scientific world  
where crisp definitions are possible.

However,  
the world up here  
that houses human free will  
is not so clear and allowing  
of such crisp definitions.

\*\*\*

Even if scientific determinism  
is not your cup of tea,  
we’re all affected by determinism  
all the time.

And we’re all affected by science  
and what scientists discover  
and what scientists say,  
and most of them  
can’t say much  
at all positive  
on free will.

So getting a handle on determinism  
can be useful in this technological age,  
where determinism and/or free will  
come up often  
and in perplexing ways.

We humans often encounter  
slightly hidden notions of determinism  
in everyday life.

Discussions often take place  
on issues like crime and punishment,  
and determinism can be seen  
lurking in the background.

Was he really guilty?  
Or was it his genetics?  
Or was it his brain washing?  
Or was it mental illness?

We hear things everyday like  
“It was the alcohol talking.”  
“Have you taken your meds?”  
“I’m not myself today.”

We go on diets  
or try to quit smoking,  
and a central life focus  
quickly becomes free will,  
and will power,  
and factors that over-power will.

And there’s more.

Determinism happens  
on the positive side as well,  
in affairs regarding  
credit, honor, and reward.

And it’s almost always puzzling.  
No one has a handle on determinism.

The strongest forms of determinism say  
that the future is already written  
for absolutely everything,  
including all of our decisions.

That’s pretty nasty!

\*\*\*

Please note, though,  
that determinism vs. free will  
is NOT the same  
as nature vs. nurture.

It’s more like  
nature PLUS nurture,  
BOTH of them versus free will.

\*\*\*

Just in case  
determinism doesn’t sound  
like a terrible monster yet  
up here at the top level,  
let me try again.

Here’s a common atomic level  
explanation of determinism:

The behavior  
of every microscopic particle  
in your brain  
is determined by the laws of Physics  
and whatever prior state  
the particle was in,  
and no decisions are involved.

Nasty!

Moving up some levels,  
here’s a common neurological level  
explanation of determinism:

Whatever brain-state I’m in now  
was fully determined by  
the brain-state I was in just prior,  
and all my previous learning,  
and no free will was involved.

Nasty!

How can this  
scientific determinism gobledygoop  
be true  
when it doesn’t seem to pan out  
in real life?

We all know  
that SOME of the time  
we can DEFINITELY make  
SOME decisions.

Do you see why this riddle is so slippery?

Determinism can set up  
a cognitive dissonance in this way.

It’s both a good guy  
and a bad guy  
at the same time.

We want to believe  
in science  
and we also want to believe  
in our free will.

But the two don’t mix well.  
It’s all turmoil and confusion,  
the harder one tries  
to figure it out.

That’s why this is such an old riddle.  
The harder we try to solve it  
the deeper it gets.

This is the deepest mystery of all science!

It’s the Holy Grail of Physics.

It’s an ongoing story  
that no one  
has been able to explain  
cleanly and neatly.

\*\*\*

I’d like now to give a short preview  
of where this is going next.

About thirty years ago  
a Philosopher named Daniel Dennett  
had several great insights  
that can greatly simplify  
our notions of free will.

This will speed things up.

Next step  
will be learning to see  
the mirror riddle’s solution  
in a certain way  
that will be useful later  
in viewing the free will riddle.

The mirror riddle tricks us  
in a way that is similar  
to the free will riddle’s trickery.

Both riddles trick us,  
though in different ways,  
to try and hold  
two opposing thoughts in our heads  
at the same time.

This is what cognitive dissonance is.

In Episode 001  
the surprising range  
of emotional responses  
these riddles can elicit  
was mentioned.

The special new way of thinking  
about these riddles  
is simply  
to compartmentalize our thoughts,  
and not allow  
the opposing thoughts  
to fight it out.

The solutions will dawn on us  
after we first clearly see  
WHY this compartmentalization  
must be done,  
and after we get  
a little PRACTICE at doing it.

Explaining this WHY  
is where I’m headed.

\*\*\*

## Episode 004 -A Tale of Two Riddles

Free Will
---------

Free will advocates bog down  
by asking for too much…  
WAY too much.

It seems  
that many old attempts  
to avoid determinism,  
and find ways to make  
free will plausible  
involved finding loopholes  
within science.

The hope was that these loopholes  
could at least point  
to free will,  
and say it’s camouflaged  
from scientific scrutiny.

In Physics,  
the popular area  
to look for loopholes  
is quantum theory.

In Mathematics,  
a type of uncertainty principle  
can be found in Godel’s Theorem,  
and some look there  
for determinism relief.

Some also resort to religion  
and say free will  
is not even physical,  
but spiritual,  
and therefore invisible to science.

Holding onto lots of hopes  
everyone bogs down  
in these pursuits,  
because all this is overkill  
and not needed.

THAT’s the insight  
Daniel Dennett provided  
in his 1984 book “Elbow Room.”

I found this book in 1992,  
but I also found it  
to be a difficult read.

But fortunately,  
Dennett spills the beans  
in the subtitle to the book which is:  
“The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting.”

This much  
in the book’s contents  
I could latch onto.

For me,  
after making these adjustments  
and pondering how much free will  
was really needed,  
and how much of it  
seemed to already be there,  
certain things became clear  
that previously were murky.

\*\*\*

Free will means being able  
to operate an agenda  
without too much interference.

Being biologically equipped,  
we gradually grow  
an internal agenda script,  
or a set of principle desires  
by which we conduct our behavior.

This agenda  
or set of principles  
can be called a creed  
or a belief system.

For many people  
there could easily be  
several of these agendas  
spliced together, and in operation.

It also seems that  
we can re-write or edit  
these scripts  
of our Internal Constitutions.

To think  
and then act  
according to what  
these scripts say  
is equivalent to saying:

these scripts are what determine  
our behavior.

But this is in conflict with this  
which was posted in Episode 003:

Atoms determine molecular behavior,  
molecules determine nerve cell behavior,  
nerve cells determine the muscle cell behavior,

This the heart of the riddle.

It’s not solved yet,  
but free will is now  
getting more simple.

\*\*\*

So,  
how much free will  
and what kind of free will  
do we need to be free?

We want the kind of free will  
that is able  
to resist other wills.

What goes on  
in the micro-machinery  
of our own brains  
is NOT in our focus  
when the topic is freedom.

23

—-  
The focus is other wills  
trying to determine  
our behavior  
and hamper our freedom.

\*\*\*

It is a slow process  
from infant to child to adult,  
but eventually a free will emerges.

Not TOTALLY free  
but somewhat free,  
as Dennett’s insight guides us.

We want the kind of free will that is  
able to edit our agenda scripts,  
able to re-write our Internal Constitutions.

We want the kind of free will that is  
able to grow in will power,  
able to increase our degree of freedom  
from other wills,  
even from previous versions of  
ourselves.

Free to change.

Dennett’s simplification is  
to picture human will  
with a relative freedom,  
not an absolute mystical freedom.

In 2003  
Dennett completely re-wrote Elbow Room  
and renamed it “Freedom Evolves.”

It’s especially nice to think  
that we can increase our freedom,  
and this idea is illustrated  
in Dennett’s newer “Freedom Evolves.”

It seems we should be happy  
with an INTERNAL will  
that is somewhat free  
of important EXTERNAL forces.

How that internal will starts off  
may be by accident,  
and not choice,  
but what gets built into it  
can be more and more  
by design  
as that will develops.

We really just don’t want  
to be pushed around  
too much  
by outside forces.

We want to think  
that we act  
on our own  
internal program,  
not someone else’s.

We want to think that  
our thoughts are our own.

\*\*\*

## Episode 005 – A Tale of Two Riddles

Mirror Solution
---------------

We’re at the threshold  
of the solutions.  
First the mirror solution  
then free will.

Later, for the free will solution,  
I’ll be using similar wording.

So this mirror solution  
will be like a template  
to later help in seeing  
the free will solution.

\*\*\*

One of the coolest surprises  
about the mirror solution  
is that it does NOT involve  
any hard core science.

The mirror solution is  
purely a people thing.

We human beings have in common  
many innate skills and strategies  
for dealing with difficult situations,  
and the mirror riddle is pretty difficult.

Two such strategies,  
or tools  
come into play  
with the mirror riddle.

We’re all very familiar  
with both of these tools,  
but giving them names  
makes for quicker reference.

I’m going to call  
these two investigation tools  
a Sherlock and a Twistie.

We will soon see  
that these tools  
are in conflict with each other  
in this mirror riddle.

This conflict is the secret  
of the mirror riddle’s  
resistance to solution.

In other words,  
these two tools,  
as good as they are,  
for many life situations,  
in THIS particular situation  
(the mirror reversal riddle)  
the two tools mess with each other,  
and they also mess with our minds  
as we ponder the mirror riddle.

In the free will riddle  
we will also see  
two useful tools  
that come into a conflict.

\*\*\*

Let’s set up the mirror scene:

Stand in front  
of your bathroom mirror,  
and raise your right arm.

The Sherlock tool says  
“Don’t move anything.”

This tool is the classic  
Sherlock Holmes technique  
for dealing with  
a complicated crime scene.

—-  
The Sherlock tool says:

Guard the mirror setup  
(you with one arm raised)  
and then examine it AS IS,  
moving nothing.

We can think  
of this Sherlock tool  
as keeping a “sure lock”  
on the mirror setup,  
with right arm raised.

\*\*\*

The other tool,  
called the Twistie  
works in the following way:

Whenever we humans  
need to compare  
NEARLY IDENTICAL objects,  
we usually prefer  
to line them up first,  
and have them face  
in the same direction,  
before we try  
to compare them.

For example:

If you wanted to compare  
two nearly identical pens,  
would you hold one pen  
pointing at twelve o’clock  
and the other pen  
pointing at three o’clock?

No,  
you would want to  
do a Twistie first,  
by turning  
one of the pens around  
to face the same direction  
as the other pen,  
and THEN  
you can compare them.

—-  
In the mirror setup,  
(still got that arm raised?)  
you and your mirror image  
are NEARLY IDENTICAL,  
except for this elusive quality  
of “reversedness.”

So,  
many of us want  
to apply a Twistie  
to the mirror setup.

But the Sherlock says  
no twisting.

But the Twistie says  
no facing  
in wrong directions.

Conflict.

\*\*\*

For the mirror,  
most people can,  
and eventually do  
settle on the Sherlock  
for solving the mirror riddle.

So,  
they lock in on the mirror setup  
(that arm getting tired?)  
and then, methodically,  
they start comparing  
up and down,  
left and right.

Applying the Sherlock tool  
shows that the mirror  
does NOT reverse  
left and right,  
NOR does it reverse  
up and down.

—-  
Both heads are pointed up,  
both raised arms are  
on the same side  
of the bathroom.

Sherlock says,  
after comparing parts,  
that only front-to-back  
are reversed.

Your nose is pointing  
in the opposite direction  
as your mirror image’s nose.

The Sherlock tool is linear,  
and methodical,  
one-step-at-a-time.

But the Twistie  
can be done mentally  
in a sudden visual flash.

\*\*\*

Remember,  
the Twistie conflicts  
with the Sherlock:

Twistie says move things,  
Sherlock says don’t move things.

\*\*\*

Twistie says:

Twist around  
to face the same direction  
as your mirror image.

You can use a crayon  
to roughly sketch,  
and thereby freeze  
your mirror image,  
(with arm raised)  
before doing the Twistie.

Now,  
in comparing parts  
it’s easy to see that  
left and right ARE reversed,  
but not up and down.

This is where  
the mirror riddle comes from:

_people doing Twisties._

\*\*\*

So,  
Twisties and Sherlocks  
conflict in their procedures,  
AND they conflict  
in their results.

Sherlocks say  
NO left/right reversal;

Twisties say  
YES left/right reversal.

\*\*\*

It sounds complicated  
but many people are very capable  
of doing Twisties mentally.

When the Twistie  
is done mentally,  
in a sudden visual flash,  
it can be totally unnoticed and subconscious,

but the left/right reversal  
from such a flash Twistie  
can make some kind  
of vague impression.

After the flash fades,  
capturing this process  
in words  
is VERY difficult.

So,  
it is the case that  
many people  
ACCIDENTALLY  
and UNKNOWINGLY  
do Twisties.

This guarantees  
for them  
a nagging sense  
of left/right reversal.

\*\*\*

Twistie flashes can even occur  
WHILE attempting to apply the  
conflicting, one-step-at-a-time  
Sherlock tool.

They can happen so fast  
people don’t know  
they are doing them.

A half dozen Twistie flashes  
can occur while attempting to do  
one of the Sherlock procedures.

When you agree with me  
that your mirror image’s  
LEFT arm is raised,  
it’s because  
you just did  
a mental Twistie.

\*\*\*

Some people have  
a type of mental discipline  
where they either  
can avoid accidental Twisties,  
or they can ignore the impressions

of left/right reversedness the Twisties make.

But for many people,  
being interrupted several times  
by mental Twisties,  
while trying  
to do a Sherlock  
gives rise to  
great mental confusion.

Sometimes,  
after following and believing  
a complete Sherlock proof  
that no left/right reversal occurs,  
a few minutes will pass,  
and then a sudden  
mental Twistie occurs.

Flash!  
There’s that pesky feeling  
of left/right reversal again.

\*\*\*

The solution to the mirror riddle  
is to become practiced  
at using both  
the Sherlock and the Twistie,

AND more importantly  
to also to become  
practiced in using them  
ONE-AT-A-TIME,

AND not allowing  
any mental drifting  
into a Twistie flash,

AND understanding why.

The solution  
to the free will riddle  
will be similar.

\*\*\*

Oh!  
You can put  
your arm down now. 🙂

## Episode 006 – A Tale of Two Riddles

Free Will Solution
------------------

Did you ever think you’d be pondering  
some of the most complicated ideas  
in the world?

If you’ve been able to follow  
these Episodes I want to congratulate you.

Hardly anyone  
ever thinks these things through.

Thinking can be an adventure,  
but it can also be hard work.

Anything new is more difficult  
than anything practiced,  
so with practice  
these thoughts  
will get more fluid.

Like with the mirror riddle  
we are now going to look at  
two common human tools  
that are used when  
the free will riddle  
is on the table.

However,  
both of these tools  
will prove to be  
far more complex  
than the Sherlock  
and the Twistie.

I wish I had snappy,  
one word names  
for both of these tools,  
like in the mirror riddle,  
but I don’t… yet.

Maybe you can help me  
to find better names later,  
but for now,  
I’ll give them temporary names.

I can also say that,  
like with the mirror riddle,  
there’s no hard core science  
in HALF of the free will solution.

A full half of the solution,  
will be a purely people thing.

\*\*\*

We human beings have in common  
many innate skills and strategies  
for dealing with difficult situations,  
and the free will riddle  
is quite difficult.

Two such strategies,  
or tools  
come into play  
with the free will riddle.

I’m going to temporarily call  
these two investigation tools

a People-View tool  
and  
a Particle-View tool,

but better names  
can be considered  
later.

Both of these tools  
are much more abstract,  
detailed, and complex  
than were the simple  
Sherlock and Twistie tools.

However, just like with  
the Sherlock and Twistie,  
we will soon see that  
these two big tools  
are in conflict  
with each other,  
when the topic is  
this free will riddle.

This conflict is the secret  
of the free will riddle’s  
resistance to solution.

In other words,  
these two tools,  
as good as they are  
for many life situations,  
in THIS particular situation  
(free will vs. determinism riddle)  
the two tools mess with each other,  
and they also mess with our minds  
as we ponder the free will riddle.

\*\*\*

Let’s set up the scene:

The People-View tool  
is what we all learn  
beginning as babies.

From early infancy  
we learn body parts,  
body actions,  
and we learn about food  
and elimination.

We learn to recognize faces,  
as well as voices and intonations,  
and eventually we learn  
that there other wills  
out there that  
sometimes thwart  
our newly forming will.

When we deal with other wills,  
one of the earliest things we learn  
is that we don’t always get our way.

We also learn early  
that people can lie,  
so dealing with  
deliberate falsehoods  
becomes part of  
the People-View tool.

Coming to expect  
that another human  
has thoughts similar  
to our own thoughts  
slowly becomes second nature.

Comparing these thoughts  
via verbal communication  
is how I see this  
People-View tool  
growing in strength  
during our early years.

\*\*\*

What I had in mind  
when I named  
the Particle-View tool,  
was dirt.

I was thinking of how  
at very early ages  
we learn that  
dirt is not people,  
and is to be cleaned off  
and gotten rid of.

We also quickly learn that  
the ground outside  
that we walk on  
is made of dirt.

Daily learning includes  
how food can be cut into  
smaller and smaller pieces,  
and that chewing food  
does the same thing.

We also quickly learn that  
we can make things  
out of dirt,  
and also that  
things can be broken down  
into dirt or junk  
or smaller pieces.

Eventually we learn  
that toys break  
and turn into junk  
and smaller pieces.

These all are  
the beginnings of  
simple science.

It’s much like the opening scene  
in the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey,”  
but instead of apes and bones  
progressing to weapons to science,  
it’s toddlers and dirt  
progressing to mud pies to science.

We’re all scientists,  
but not all of us  
dive very deep into it,  
or stick with it very long,  
and hardly any of us  
ever get paid for it.

But the basic  
procedures and attitudes  
of hard core scientists  
can often be seen active  
in teenagers living everyday lives.

The reason  
I’m focusing on science  
is because that’s where  
determinism comes from.

\*\*\*

I don’t believe we start building  
this simple science Particle-View tool  
at birth,  
like we do  
with the People-View tool.

Though it probably starts out  
very early with dirt,  
I can’t see it going strong  
until some decent language skills  
are learned.

Scientific knowledge is built  
by many people  
via language.

We all use  
this simple science  
Particle-View tool  
but negative associations  
often cause many to limit  
its full blown development.

Remember,  
in an earlier episode  
I mentioned that  
your car mechanic  
and your hair stylist  
were scientists?

We all engage  
in some scientific thinking,  
and we all use  
the Particle-View tool,  
but we usually don’t  
make a big deal out if it.

What’s most important  
to us here  
about this tool  
is the conflict it has  
with the People-View tool,  
in this particular topic of  
free will versus determinism.

This will be illustrated soon.

\*\*\*

In using the Particle-View tool  
we use the technique of analysis,  
which means cutting things up  
(literally or figuratively)  
into smaller pieces  
and looking at  
all the parts  
that make up the whole.

The People-View tool never involves  
cutting other people up  
into pieces,  
hence the term “individual.”

Psychotics may confuse the tools  
at times like this,  
but not normal people.

Sometimes,  
we will switch  
from the People-View tool,  
to the Particle-View tool,  
and try to figuratively cut up  
another will into pieces  
so that it can be analyzed.

But this is usually  
not very accurate,  
and not appreciated  
by that other will,  
and we learn  
to minimize  
such behavior.

The Particle-View tool  
works well for dirt,  
and for things and objects,  
but not for people.

\*\*\*

The Particle-View tool  
never involves  
trying to communicate  
with whatever we have put  
into a test tube,  
because it’s dead.

Sure, science looks  
at living biological organisms,  
and beings similar to us,  
some communication may take place,  
but not when the parts are looked at.

The deeper science looks  
into how matter works,  
the smaller and smaller are the parts,  
and the more simple and lifeless  
are the parts.

It’s not that they’re dull and uninteresting.  
They do have their beauty and fascinations,  
BUT they’re far, far more simple  
than the worlds of life, people, and thoughts.

This is also why  
I used the word “particle”  
in the name.

Eventually the word “atom”  
comes up.

\*\*\*

Another big difference  
between the two tools  
is honesty.

For several hundred years,  
science has taken the stand  
that nature can never lie or deceive,  
and this assumption has worked out  
pretty darn well.

I’ve never known  
of anyone to challenge it.

So,  
unlike with the People-View tool,  
when using the Particle-View tool  
we never have to deal with lying atoms.

Only people can lie well.

A few animals and plants  
have crude deception abilities,  
but nature, in the micro,  
is the epitome of honesty.

Deception just never comes up  
in the world of micro particles,  
and nature simply cannot lie,  
nor even make a mistake,  
nor even be sloppy.

Lying requires a lot of intelligence,  
with systems and sub-systems  
to support it.

\*\*\*

It’s a very tight world  
we see when using  
the Particle-View tool.

It’s a world that’s  
way TOO tight  
to support free will decisions,  
and that’s the reason  
determinism seems to threaten  
us in these matters.

Atoms don’t have a will,  
and they can’t  
change their mind.

They always obey.

Their world is simple this way.

\*\*\*

The People-View tool is SUBJECTIVE.  
It’s for the subjects in the kingdom.  
It’s personal.

The Particle-View tool is OBJECTIVE.

It’s for the objects in the kingdom.  
It’s impersonal.

\*\*\*

Tabulated below are some  
qualities,  
or attitudes,  
or activities,  
or participating agents  
involved with these two tools.

First,  
some poles  
they are apart by.

On the left: People-View;  
on the right: Particle-View:

whole – parts  
smart – stupid  
profound – trivial  
advanced – primitive

Unique to People-View are :  
life, language, love, family,  
respect, civilization, lies.

Unique to Particle-View are:  
precision, predictability,  
repeatability, determinism

Each tool  
can be thought of as  
a set of special vision goggles  
equipped with special interactive abilities,  
like Humanities Goggles  
and Science Goggles.

These two tools  
are SO VERY different,  
that a neat, simplistic way of  
describing their conflict  
is to say they are pointed  
in opposite directions.

Facing North,  
the view that can be seen  
is TOTALLY different  
from the view seen  
facing South.

The two directions  
are mutually exclusive,  
in that looking in one direction  
prevents viewing the other direction.

That’s what these  
two tools are like  
with respect to each other.

\*\*\*

Science and its Particle-View tool,  
have been very successful  
for about four hundred years,  
largely because  
the HUMAN ELEMENT is  
systematically stripped out  
from all of its  
attitudes,  
and activities,  
and participating agents.

But the HUMAN ELEMENT  
is what the People-View tool,  
is all about!

This means that  
the Particle-View tool,  
BY DESIGN,  
pretty much ignores  
all that is seen with  
the People-View tool.

And the plot thickens:

The People-View tool  
totally ignores the micro world,  
the world determinism comes from.

The resolution and quantification  
of our human senses  
are too poor  
to engage in micro experiences.

All of the participating agents  
and all of the activities  
of the micro world  
are an unrecognized blip  
to the People-View tool.

Meanwhile,  
Science and its Particle-View tool  
is ALL ABOUT extending its view  
far beyond what  
human senses  
and the People-View tool  
can engage in.

\*\*\*

So,  
the People-View tool  
and Particle-View tool  
are figuratively aimed in  
opposite directions.

They even oppose each other.

What the People-View sees  
can not be seen  
by the Particle-View.

What the Particle-View sees  
can not be seen  
by the People-View.

They are completely different ways  
of looking at the world,  
of tinkering with the world,  
and of explaining situations in it.

The views they produce  
are ALSO mutually exclusive.

This is a very strong difference.

\*\*\*

Another great difference  
between these tools  
is repeatability.

One way science deals  
with lies and sloppiness  
is by stripping out  
all data that’s not repeatable.

The great surety of science  
comes largely from repeatability  
being a part of the Particle-View tool.

Repeatability, though,  
whenever a human brain is involved,  
is not nearly as reachable an idea  
as it is in the micro world.

Doing a controlled experiment  
with people  
is not the same kind of thing  
as a controlled Physics experiment.

Surety is not a part  
of the world we see  
with the People-View tool.

Nothing with people  
can ever exactly be repeated;  
only approximately.

So,  
repeatability is  
impossible in human affairs,  
and necessary in scientific affairs.

\*\*\*

We can’t see determinism  
in the people world  
with the People-View tool.

We cant see people  
in the determinism world  
with the Particle-View tool.

The two tools face  
in opposite directions!

\*\*\*

The solution to the free will riddle  
is to become practiced  
at using both  
the People-View tool  
and the Particle-View tool,

AND more importantly  
to also become  
practiced in using them  
ONE-AT-A-TIME,

AND not allowing  
any mental drifting  
from one to the other,

AND understanding why.

To ask

“How we can have free will  
in the face of microscopic determinism?”

is trying to mix two antagonistic views  
into one thought.

Solving the riddle comes  
by learning to not drift  
from the human world  
containing free will,  
over to the science world,  
containing determinism,  
because it produces turmoil  
through the conflicting tools.

This is not trivial.

Few of us  
are very disciplined  
at such compartmentalized thought.

Some are,  
and they may ask,  
what’s all the fuss about?

But for most of us,  
learning to think through  
each tool’s unique view  
ONE-AT-A-TIME  
is very new.

So,  
the baffling nature  
of the free will riddle  
is directly due to us  
UNKNOWINGLY trying to fit together  
two fundamentally antagonistic worlds.

\*\*\*

Imaging a person  
having a difficult time  
understanding why  
it is impossible to see South  
while facing North.

Such a person  
would have to be  
totally unaware of  
the simple geometry  
that facing North cuts off  
all of the view of the South  
BECAUSE they are opposite.

This person needs  
to be taught  
that facing North  
and facing South  
are mutually exclusive,

and then it is possible  
for this person to be content  
with seeing each view  
ONE-AT-A-TIME.

We can become content  
with a solid knowing that  
WHILE we are thinking about our free will,  
we must WAIT on bringing up determinism.

Learning to see  
that determinism and free will  
are valid within their own worlds,  
but meaningless when  
intruding in another world,  
is very new to us.

\*\*\*

Is THAT all there IS?

Yes.

\*\*\*

However,

if  
there is any doubt  
or lack of clarity  
that the Particle-View tool  
and the People-View tool  
are opposites,  
that they deeply OPPOSE each other,  
that they are mutually exclusive,  
that they are  
COMPLETELY different ways  
of looking at the world,

then  
this answer will seem lacking.

To the degree  
that the two tools  
can be seen as opposites,  
like facing North and facing South,  
then learning to think about  
free will and determinism  
SEPARATELY  
will become  
a satisfying  
answer.

This degree can be increased,  
and the next Episode will address this.

Also, there are advanced ways  
to dimly see free will,  
far off in the distance  
while using the Particle-View tool.

There are also advanced ways  
to squintingly see determinism  
way down underfoot  
while using the People-View tool.

These advanced ways of thinking  
will also come up in the next Episode.

In the meantime,  
we can become  
more and more satisfied  
with this solution by

(1) getting practice seeing  
the two tools as opposites and  
(2) getting practice at resisting  
the urge to quickly switch tools midstream.  
Have fun  
as the solution emerges  
from this small disciplined effort.
