# Natural Information Gain

These resources should provide a solid foundation for understanding how non-thinking processes can gather information and become more organized through evolutionary mechanisms, countering the claims made by creationist perspectives.

* [Evolution of Biological Information](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC102656/): This article discusses how genetic systems gain information through evolutionary processes, utilizing Claude Shannon's information theory to measure changes in genetic control systems. It demonstrates that information can indeed be gained through mutation and selection, challenging the notion that evolution cannot produce new information.

* [Accumulation and Maintenance of Information in Evolution](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2123152119): This paper from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences explores how selection processes accumulate and maintain genetic information over generations, emphasizing that evolutionary mechanisms can lead to increased organization and complexity in biological systems.

* [Evolutionary Rates of Information Gain and Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03406): This research examines how information dynamics occur in fluctuating environments, providing insights into how evolutionary processes can lead to both information gain and loss. It offers a quantitative approach to understanding these mechanisms within an evolutionary framework.
