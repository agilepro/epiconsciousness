# Material Positivism

MP is a framework for understanding life, the universe, and everything.  It is founded in materialism based on the latest and most complete physical descriptions of the universe.  It is an evidence based philosophy that admits nothing beyond what can be demonstrated.

At the same time it recognizes the poetic reality of existence itself: how the universe is actually growing in all ways, and this growth is the reason for being.  From this simple realization we can understand our purpose and the relationship between us and the universe.


**[Enlightenment is a Journey](enlightenment-is-a-journey)** - I invite you to join on this journey of transcendence, to explore the basics of being, and of becoming.  We must always work to peel back the layers of the onion, using each new insight to start on the next layer.  We must stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before us, and to see further than anyone ever imagined.

**[Meaning of Life](meaning-of-life)** - A high level poetic view of existence and how it fits into reality.

**[Structure of Reality](structure-of-reality)** - Lays out the basic categories of existence so that we can start to put labels on things to discuss relationships.

**[Understanding Orgos](understanding-orgos)** - Orgos is essentially the purpose of the universe.  I know that sounds crazy, but hang in there and this page attempts to explain what I mean.

**[Ethics](mp-definition)** - Meaning and purpose must also be related to how we evaluate good and evil in the Material Positivist view.  The purpose of the universe enlightens the connection.  Much more on ethics is explored separately in other parts of this site.

**[Holy Spirit](holy-spirit)** - Humans are material entities that are both part of the universe and distinct from the universe.  Humans play a particular role in the universe bringing in a super power I call the holy spirit.

**[Immanence](immanence)** - Here we talk about the relationship between the universe and the creator of the universe: God.  Both are deeply and perpetually intertwined with each other.  Creation never stops, and the creator is never fully elaborated, but both are perpetually becoming.
