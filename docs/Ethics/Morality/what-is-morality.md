# What is Morality?

We start with some definitions of terms.

**Morality** is concerned with distinguishing what is right from what is wrong; good from evil; sin from virtue.  In all cases we are talking about *conduct* which is actions that you do.  Here are some definitions from dictionaries:  

*   a doctrine or system of moral conduct
*   conformity to ideals of right human conduct
*   The quality of being in accord with standards of right or good conduct
*   A system or collection of ideas of right and wrong conduct

**Actions** are measured by morality.  Morality, simply put, is a way to distinguish good actions (those which you should do) from bad actions (those which you should not do).  It is a way of measuring the goodness of an action.

The morality of an action depends not only on the act itself, but also the context as well as who is involved.  Starting a fire in a campsite fireplace is probably a good action, starting a fire in a crowded airplane definitely a bad action.   The entire situation must be measured and compared with other acts that could be performed in that situation.

**Subjective** is about things defined within the mind in relation to perceptions which might be unique to each individual subject:

*   characteristic of or belonging to reality as perceived rather than as independent of mind
*   relating to or being experience or knowledge as conditioned by personal mental characteristics or states
*   peculiar to a particular individual
*   arising out of or identified by means of one’s perception of one’s own states and processes
*   Not caused by external stimuli.
*   Dependent on or taking place in a person’s mind rather than the external world.

**Objective** is about things that are outside of an individual mind, and can be observed by any number of people the same way:

*   expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations
*   having reality independent of the mind
*   involving or deriving from sense perception or experience with actual objects, conditions, or phenomena
*   not influenced by personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudice; based on facts; unbiased
*   intent upon or dealing with things external to the mind rather than with thoughts or feelings

## Context and Locality

When considering whether an action is moral or not, we must consider the context.  Breaking glass is normally a bad thing to do, but if there is a fire then breaking the glass to get to a fire alarm is considered a good thing.  But only when there is a fire.

Notice that there is a built in assumption that the morality of an action can be judged by the immediate local circumstances: usually a physical area of a few meters, a time duration of less than an hour, and a participant dimension of only one or two people.  

Cheating on a test involves the person taking the test at the time and location that the test is given.  We assume that a passenger getting on a flight in Hong Kong, or a hunter in the middle of Alaska will have no relevance to this decision.  We normally also assume that it has nothing to do with the student sitting next to the cheater.  Thus normally morals actions are judged only by circumstances in their locality, and we can ignore the other 8 billion people on the planet.

Of course there could be occasions where things far and wide actually are relevant.  We might call those *extenuating circumstances*.  Circumstances 

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

, but the point is that in most cases we can ignore the rest of the billion people on the planet and what they are doing.  That is a good thing because

We limit the context of consideration to the immediate surroundings by assuming that nothing outside the immediate surroundings is relevant.  This is a simplifying assumption that moral questions can be decided locally.  If we had to consider the entire universe while trying to decide whether to break the glass or not we would never make any decision.  There is in fact no principle that a morality must be decided by the local environment, and there are cases where morality is dependent upon things that are far away.

## Rules

If morality is the right way to act, we also have rules which guidelines to follow to approximate moral behavior.

The true moral action in a situation must consider the complete situation which provides the context for that action. Ultimately that context extends to include everything in the universe.  We often talk about extenuating circumstances, and what we mean by that is circumstances that are outside the normal theater of interaction.  All moral action can be considered moral for the context, but in this case we are saying the context is a bit more extended than normal.
