# What is Morality?

We start with some definitions of terms.

**Morality** is concerned with distinguishing what is right from what is wrong; good from evil; sin from virtue.  In all cases we are talking about *conduct* which is actions that you do.  Here are some definitions from dictionaries:  

*   a doctrine or system of moral conduct
*   conformity to ideals of right human conduct
*   The quality of being in accord with standards of right or good conduct
*   A system or collection of ideas of right and wrong conduct

**Actions** are measured by morality.  Morality, simply put, is a way to distinguish good actions (those which you should do) from bad actions (those which you should not do).  It is a way of measuring the goodness of an action.

The morality of an action depends not only on the act itself, but also the context as well as who is involved.  Starting a fire in a campsite fireplace is probably a good action, starting a fire in a crowded airplane definitely a bad action.   The entire situation must be measured and compared with other acts that could be performed in that situation.

**Subjective** is about things defined within the mind in relation to perceptions which might be unique to each individual subject:

*   characteristic of or belonging to reality as perceived rather than as independent of mind
*   relating to or being experience or knowledge as conditioned by personal mental characteristics or states
*   peculiar to a particular individual
*   arising out of or identified by means of one’s perception of one’s own states and processes
*   Not caused by external stimuli.
*   Dependent on or taking place in a person’s mind rather than the external world.

**Objective** is about things that are outside of an individual mind, and can be observed by any number of people the same way:

*   expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations
*   having reality independent of the mind
*   involving or deriving from sense perception or experience with actual objects, conditions, or phenomena
*   not influenced by personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudice; based on facts; unbiased
*   intent upon or dealing with things external to the mind rather than with thoughts or feelings
