# Biblical Morality

## What Christians Say about Others

> “In a world without God, there can be no objective right and wrong, only our culturally and personally relative, subjective judgments. This means that it is impossible to condemn war, oppression, or crime as evil. Nor can one praise brotherhood, equality, and love as good. For in a universe without God, good and evil do not exist—there is only the bare valueless fact of existence, and there is no one to say you are right and I am wrong.”
> -- William Lane Craig, [‘The Absurdity of Life without God’, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 18 Dec 2013](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/the-absurdity-of-life-without-god/)

Even without God, we can appeal to something outside of our ‘culturally and personally relative, subjective judgments’.

> “. . . this indignation is perfectly groundless if we ourselves regard morality as a subjective sentiment to be altered at will. Unless there is some objective standard of good, overarching Germans, Japanese, and ourselves alike whether any of us obey it or no, then of course the Germans are as competent to create their ideology as we are to create ours.”
> -- C. S. Lewis, ‘The Poison of Subjectivism’, Christian Reflections

Moral objectivity requires forgetting nationality; thinking impartially. E.g.: Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).

> “A good atheist — that is, a consistent atheist — recognizes this dilemma. His only reasonable conclusion is to reject objective meaning and morality. Thus, calling him “good” in the moral sense is nonsensical. There is no morally good atheist, because there really is no objective morality. At best, morality is the mass delusion shared by humanity, protecting us from the cold sting of despair.”
> -- Pastor Rick Henderson, [‘Why There Is No Such Thing as a Good Atheist’](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-good-atheist_b_4442287)

Our ability to think impartially is not ‘mass delusion’. Taking a moral stance means adopting a non-partisan attitude.

## Divine Command Theory

For these, objectivity is about an other-worldly source of ethics.  Harkening back to Augustine of Hippo.

Euthyphro Dilemma: Does god like the good because it is good, or is it good because God loves it?  In the first case, morality must be independent of god.  In the second case, then things that are good simply because god loves it, and it makes morality arbitrary.  Divine capriciousness.

## Knowability of God

The sources are flakey at best, mendacious manipulation at worst.

## Christian Arrogance

While it is good that Christians aspire to be moral, the insistence that they are the only possible moral actors in the world does a deep disservice to the hundreds of other traditions that are equally moral.  And history has no shown Christians to be any more moral than any other major world culture. 

Christians seem to be blind to the good actors that are around them, even going so far as to claim that non-Christians are simply accidentally acting on Christian sourced principles without knowing it.

## Responses to Christians

The old testament is filled with stories of holy genocide.  The early tribes of Israel were in fact warring tribes, and the myths of a bible are clearly meant to motivate the population to do the will of the warlord.  How can the destruction of the Amalakites possibly be considered moral?
