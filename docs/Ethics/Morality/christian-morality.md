# Biblical Morality

Theists in general agree that morals must be objective, and they see these morals coming from God.

## Moral Foundation Needed

Christians rightly argue that without objective morality, there can be no basis for talking about what one should and should not do.  If my morals can be different from your morals, then anything I do is right, and anything you do is right as well.  

If everybody can claim that sea level is defined by whatever level they are at, it becomes very difficult to talk about the altitude difference between two people: both are at sea level, even if one is thousands of feet higher.

## Divine Command Theory

While theists may be right about the need and existence of universal moral truths, they make a simplistic assumption about the source:  they say that God must have simply created them, along with everything else that God created in the world.

It has been that pattern in all primitive cultures that when those people can not imagine the source of something, when they can not understand how they form, they then simply conclude that something must have made it.  Since the making of such things are inconceivably hard, they assume the maximally powerful being would be needed, and there is only one of those: God.

## Knowability of God's Truths

The bible itself is inconsistent about moral advice.

* Slavery, now regarded as evil, was accepted by the writers of the bible as normal behavior
* Food illnesses caused various taboos that are no longer relevant since germ theory was discovered
* Practices around dealing with leprosy and other diseases were often harmful
* The old testament is filled with stories of holy genocide.  The early tribes of Israel were in fact warring tribes, and the myths of a bible are clearly meant to motivate the population to do the will of the warlord.  How can the destruction of the Amalekites possibly be considered moral?

Mature Christians don't claim that morality comes from the bible, but that God's morality was written on the hearts of men, atheist and theist alike.  We know right from wrong, and you have a choice in following.

## Righteous Arrogance

While it is good that Christians aspire to be moral, the insistence that they are the only possible moral actors in the world does a deep disservice to the hundreds of other traditions that are equally moral.  And history has no shown Christians to be any more moral than any other major world culture. 

Christians seem to be blind to the good actors that are around them, even going so far as to claim that non-Christians are simply accidentally acting on Christian sourced principles without knowing it.

## Lawgiver is Unnecessary

Thinking that moral truths must be invented by a God is as silly as thinking that boat design truths must be invented by God.  The fact is that these truths are true because they work, and not because of any divine manufacture.

This view on morality completely eliminates the Euthyphro Dilemma: Good actions are not good because God commands them, but instead they are good because they work to the success of the actors.

## Questions

> "Here's a question for those who deny God: If you don’t believe in absolute truth, on what basis do you condemn bearing false witness? According to God’s standard, false witnesses are accountable and deserve justice (Deuteronomy 19:18-19). But in a worldview without God, where morality is subjective, isn’t lying just another choice? So, what’s your basis for condemning it—personal preference?"

Banning lies has a beneficial effect on the society that bans them. People in that society live longer, live better, and survive to produce more offspring.

A society that says it is OK to lie will die out. It is as simply as that: allowing lies is evil for this reason. Banning lies is good for this reason.

No god is needed.  Morality is not subjective. 

## What Christians Say about Others

> “In a world without God, there can be no objective right and wrong, only our culturally and personally relative, subjective judgments. This means that it is impossible to condemn war, oppression, or crime as evil. Nor can one praise brotherhood, equality, and love as good. For in a universe without God, good and evil do not exist—there is only the bare valueless fact of existence, and there is no one to say you are right and I am wrong.”
> -- William Lane Craig, [‘The Absurdity of Life without God’, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 18 Dec 2013](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/the-absurdity-of-life-without-god/)

Even without God, we can appeal to something outside of our ‘culturally and personally relative, subjective judgments’.

> “. . . this indignation is perfectly groundless if we ourselves regard morality as a subjective sentiment to be altered at will. Unless there is some objective standard of good, overarching Germans, Japanese, and ourselves alike whether any of us obey it or no, then of course the Germans are as competent to create their ideology as we are to create ours.”
> -- C. S. Lewis, ‘The Poison of Subjectivism’, Christian Reflections

Moral objectivity requires forgetting nationality; thinking impartially. E.g.: Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).

> “A good atheist — that is, a consistent atheist — recognizes this dilemma. His only reasonable conclusion is to reject objective meaning and morality. Thus, calling him “good” in the moral sense is nonsensical. There is no morally good atheist, because there really is no objective morality. At best, morality is the mass delusion shared by humanity, protecting us from the cold sting of despair.”
> -- Pastor Rick Henderson, [‘Why There Is No Such Thing as a Good Atheist’](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-good-atheist_b_4442287)

Our ability to think impartially is not ‘mass delusion’. Taking a moral stance means adopting a non-partisan attitude.
