# Humanism

> In the face of religious polemics, counting ourselves as 'subjectivists' or 'relativists' puts us at a significant social and political disadvantage. -- Leslie Allen, Director Humanists of Australia

Six different theories on morality that require no divinity:

* Ideal Observer (David Hume)
* Categorical Imperative (Immanuel Kant)
* Utilitarianism (Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, Peter Singer)
* Prescriptivism (Richard Hare)
* Social Contract (John Rawls)
* Stoic Cosmopolitanism (Massimo Pigliucci, John Shook)
