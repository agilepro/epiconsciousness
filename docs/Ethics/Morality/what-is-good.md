# What is Good?

What is a good life?  What makes a particular action good, and another action bad?

## Long Term View

Anyone who has thought about this more than a moment will understand that this is not about superficial pleasure or short term good feelings.  Simply doing what feels good at the moment will often lead to behaviors that you later regret.  

Instead, a person can look back on a good life on with satisfaction that the right actions were taken at all the right times in order to say that the best outcomes were achieved in the long term.  In some cases you will have to endure hardship to do the right thing.  Or experience very unpleasant things.  The idea is that in some measure it is "worth it" to do the right things.

## Oriented to Collective Good

Good for whom?  An action that is good only for the agent is considered selfish, and not really good in a moral sense.  A right action needs to be good for more than the individual making the choice.

Good for what group?  Humans naturally live in groups.  A good action should be good for at least the immediate family or tribe, but even that really is not enough.  While a particular tribe might find it convenient to throw their waste on another tribe's land, it would not be considered a moral act.  There is a sense that a good action should be on the balance good for all of humanity.

Even humanity is not quite inclusive enough.  We talk about animals rights along with the morality of cruelty to animals.  So what is the scope?  There is a feeing that the action has to be right from some kind of universal perspective.  That is, a good action is fundamentally good in itself.

## Tradeoffs

A good action may not be purely good in all aspects.  In the case of the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) one choice kills five people and the other kills one person. Both choices involve a tragedy.  

Whatever the formulation of good we end up with, it must somehow take into account that there will be many consequences from a single decision.  

## Existence

At the root level one must see that survival is one the true "good" that exists.  The action that leads to the survival of the most will generally be the action considered "good".  

Survival is a very stark measure.  One can imagine a scenario where everyone survives but the they are in constant torture and misery that maybe a different outcome is better. Living is not binary: it not just that your heart is beating, but in fact life is a complex multifaceted dynamic state of being.  The consequentialists call it "flourishing" to say that life if more than just a heartbeat.  If you see existence as a continuum from barely a heartbeat to a full and active life of interactions with friends and family, then you see that existence is the key desire.

Morals are behaviors that bring about the most human existence, the most flourishing of humans on a universal scale.   The next few chapter will delve into different moral systems and how effective they are in increasing the amount of existence.
