# Introduction

This book is for everyone who has lived, and wondered what was the right way to live.  It may be easy to know what you want to do at the moment, but how should I live my life the right way that will preserve what I have short term gain, only to find that I have squandered more in the long term as a consequence.

Ancient philosophers debated the question of how to live the _right life_ (also called the _good life_ or _eudaimonia_). It is a question that was probably first asked at the time mankind first began to talk.

Many of of my non-religious friends struggle to understand what should be considered the source of morality.  These are fine upstanding moral people.  They understand what it means to be fair, good, and kind.  They would not live their lives any other way.  But they are not really sure where morals come from.  

So much written about morality comes from a religious point of view.  The Christians and the Muslims each arrogantly claim to have an exclusive access to morality, and readily spew invectives calling everyone else is baseless immoral heathens, especially atheists.  History is replete with examples of religious wars, religious persecution, burning atheists at stakes for not believing the right things, and so many examples of religions not living up to the claim of being moral.

Many non-religious friends live as moral life as any church mouse, but struggle to find the right life, sometimes claiming the opposite of what religious zealots claim.  Having escaped from the traps of religion, they are loath to cite religion as the source of morality.  By avoiding the trappings of superstition they go too far by rejecting all external sources of right being, and taking a subjective or relativist approach to morality.

What I aim to do here is to blaze a middle path along the golden mean which recognizes how to live the right life, seeing the fundamental goodness of nature, while at the same time accepting an evidence based material reality around us.  We can navigate this course with some assurance of what it right and what is wrong.

We will proceed cautiously:

1. The first chapter will start with some definitions so that we have a foundation to discuss morality with confidence.  So much has been written that most words are used in many ways, so we will set out with some care what we mean here.

2. Subjective morality is the first trap and the place where many non-religious people tread feeling that there is no other choice between that and religious morality.  This is a mistake, and we will explore the various ways that subjective morality does not fill the need.

3. Moral Relativism is the second trap we will explore is  which is professed by few however it is important to clearly distinguish what this is and why it is not reasonable.

4. Goodness is not an arbitrary preference.  There is a fact to the matter, that good actions are meaningfully good in that they consist of behavior that helps the tribe to survive.  A tribe that adopts bad morals would not survive.  The connection between survival and the goodness of actions has been largely overlooked, and that connection makes morality real.

5. There is no magic in the formation of objective truths.  I will cover a couple of analogous situations in which objective truths emerge from the physicality of the universe.  This will support the idea that objective moral truths emerge from human behavior in an evolutionary fashion.

6. We then glance quickly at religious/biblical morality as a form of objective morality but it has traps of its own.  

7. Moral Objectivism is then presented in a way contrasted with the other approaches.

8. Love is the concluding topic of the book.

9. Call to Action, how to use this in your daily life.  How to talk clearly about moral foundations with others.
