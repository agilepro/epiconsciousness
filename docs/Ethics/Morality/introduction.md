# Introduction

This book is for everyone who has lived, and wondered what was the right way to live.  It is easy to know what you want to do at the moment, but how should I live my life the right way that will not squander what I have now for short term gain, only to find that I lose more in the long term as a consequence.

How to live the right life was the subject of some of the most ancient philosophical writings of all time, starting with the first philosophers we know of, and probably since the time mankind first began to talk.

I see many of of my non-religious friends struggle to understand what should be considered morality and what guide to follow.  Having escaped from the traps of religion, they are loath to go back to those sources, and yet so much written about morality seems to come from a religious point of view.  The Christians and the Muslim each arrogantly claim to have an exclusive access to morality, and have phrases ready to spew that everyone else is baseless immoral heathens.

I also see many non-religious friends who live as moral life as any church mouse, but struggle to find the right life by claiming the opposite of what religious zealots claim.  By avoiding the trappings of superstition they go too far by rejecting all external sources of right being, and taking a subjective or relativist approach to morality.

What I aim to do here is to blaze a middle path along the golden mean which recognizes how to live the right life, seeing the fundamental goodness of nature, while at the same time accepting an evidence based material reality around us.  We can navigate this course with some assurance of what it right and what is wrong.

We will process cautiously:

1. The first chapter will start with some definitions so that we have a foundation to discuss the rest confidently.  So much has been written that most words are used in many ways, so we will set out with some care what we mean here.

2. Goodness is the subject of the second chapter, both good as in welfare as well as good in terms of rightness.  These two meanings overlap.  We find in both meanings of good the goal for all human behavior.

3. Moral relativism is the first trap we will explore is  which is professed by few however it is important to clearly distinguish what this is and why it is not reasonable.

4. Subjective morality is the second trap and the place where many non-religious people tread feeling that there is no other choice between that and religious morality.  This is a mistake, and we will explore the various ways that subjective morality does not fill the need.

5. We then glance quickly at religious morality to explore what is good and what is bad about this approach.  We can see the claims that are made, what they mean, what people actually do, and what benefits and harms can come from that.

6. Objective Morality is then presented in a way contrasted with the earlier approaches.

7. 8. (further)

9. Love is the concluding topic of the book.

I hope you will join me though the complete journey.
