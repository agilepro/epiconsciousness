# Subjective Morality

To say that a morality is subjective is to say that it varies from person to person, that it cannot be referred to without reference to an individual (or set of individuals). It means to say that there is no morality outside of the individual (or set of individuals). Thus, societal standards are also subjective.

Subjective does not necessarily mean related to feeling; it simply means that it varies from person to person (_subiectum_ is Latin for the agent in a sentence or situation).

## Meaning Of Subjective

The best example of a subjective claim is that of your favorite flavor of ice cream.  When faced with choosing a flavor, however you pick that is based on your own memory of experiences in the past, and your own estimation of what you would like to experience today.  If you decide that "Cherry Garcia" is your favorite flavor, then that is what your favorite flavor is.  

Nobody can say you are wrong.  I can not say that your favorite is not that, or that in fact your favorite flavor is "Dutch Chocolate".  I can suggest arguments that it should not be such, but I can not truthfully say that you are "wrong" and that your favorite is not that.  I have no access to your memories or your desires.  A subjective claim is true if you say it is true, and nobody can argue otherwise.

If a moral claim was subjective, then whatever you claim would by definition be true.  If you claim that drinking alcohol is a actually a good moral behavior, then nobody can ever say you are wrong.  Alcohol drinking would be good (for you) because you say it is good.

But actions have effects on the world, which in turn have objective consequences.  You may believe that drinking arsenic is a good moral action, but you will die from that, and that is objectively bad.  We will delve into more detail later, but just understand that a subjective opinion, like your favorite flavor of ice cream, can not be claimed by anyone else to be false.

## Actions Have Objective Consequences

You can not simply "decide" what is good and bad.

You can pass a law requiring a behavior, but you can't simply decide that the law is good.  For example: if you made a law that every person has to chop off their right hand.  You can pass that law, but the law is inherently bad.  You can not make it morally good.  The reason: because the entire society will be harmed and will do worse when nobody has two hands, more people will die, more people will starve, more people will suffer.  These make the law bad no matter what you decide.

400 years ago the practice of bloodletting was considered a right and moral action.  The theory was that too much blood was the cause of some illness.  A majority of doctors agreed that letting out the excess blood was the right things to to.  Bloodletting was "good" and in fact it would be immoral to prevent a doctor from performing bloodletting in those situations.  Later we learned that actually the problem is not that there is too much blood, and in fact removal of blood would actually weaken the sick person.  It was the discovery of the adverse consequence of bloodletting that we were able to determine that bloodletting itself is immoral.  Even though people mistakenly thought it was moral, no amount of thinking it was moral can actually make it moral.

An action that causes harm is bad, even if you subjectively think it is good.

## The Claim And The Reality

Much of the source of disagreement comes from the semantics of the word morality.  In the first chapter on definition, I point out four layers of morality.  There is a layer (3) where people claim what they believe to be moral, and then there is a different layer (1) for what is actually universally moral.

When someone says that morality is subjective, they mean that each of us claims what we believe to be moral.  Thus I believe it is moral to eat ice cream on Sunday.  That is just a claim that I make, but it is not an actual definition of what is and is not moral.  I might be wrong.  There might be some reason that eating ice cream on Sunday is bad for everyone, and decreases the survivability of the community.  (I doubt it, but the point is that I can be wrong about this claim.)

Claiming that eating ice cream on Sunday is moral, does not make it moral.  There exists a deeper objective moral assessment that can be used (if we know it) to state that my claim is right or wrong.  That is what the universal morals do, and that is the objective moral that I write about.

Some people call these by a different name.  Let's not argue about semantics.  I am calling the objective assessment of whether an action is good or bad "Universal Morals".  The claims that people make might be their best approximation to these morals, but they can be wrong, and thus don't point to the real morality of the universe.

## What Is The Problem?

By arguing that morals are just subjective, we lose the higher moral ground from which to persuade the right action in situations.  A subjective opinion where the statement of the opinion makes it so.  You favorite ice cream is your favorite and nobody can say you are wrong.  But your claim about morality can be right or wrong, and that is what tells us that morality is not subjective.
