# Subjective Morality

To say that a morality is subjective is to say that it varies from person to person, that it cannot be referred to without reference to an individual (or set of individuals). It means to say that there is no morality outside of the individual (or set of individuals). Thus, societal standards are also subjective.

Subjective does not necessarily mean related to feeling; it simply means that it varies from person to person (subiectum is Latin for the agent in a sentence).

## Morality is not just what you decide

You can not simply "decide" what is good and bad.

You can pass a law requiring a behavior, but you can't simply decide that the law is good.  For example: if you made a law that every person has to chop off their right hand.  You can pass that law, but the law is inherently bad.  You can not make it morally good.  The reason: because the entire society will be harmed and will do worse when nobody has two hands, more people will die, more people will starve, more people will suffer.  These make the law bad no matter what you decide.

## Questions

> "Here's a question for those who deny God: If you don’t believe in absolute truth, on what basis do you condemn bearing false witness? According to God’s standard, false witnesses are accountable and deserve justice (Deuteronomy 19:18-19). But in a worldview without God, where morality is subjective, isn’t lying just another choice? So, what’s your basis for condemning it—personal preference?"

Banning lies has a beneficial effect on the society that bans them. People in that society live longer, live better, and survive to produce more offspring.

A society that says it is OK to lie will die out. It is as simply as that: allowing lies is evil for this reason. Banning lies is good for this reason.

No god is needed.  Morality is not subjective. 

## What is the Problem?

By arguing that morals are just subjective, we lose the higher moral ground from which to persuade the right action in situations.
