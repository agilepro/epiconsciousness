# Alive

The universe is alive.  It is not dead.  The universe is in a constant state of creation and turn-over.  It is animated; it moves.  I writing this in contrast to a feeling that the universe is itself dead, except for a relatively few animating spirits.

# Spirits

People are inclined to think that the universe is dead, except for a small number of agents that cause actions.  without those agents, the universe would be cold, dark, and still.  Well, not necessarily dark -- things like the sun and stars would still shine.  And not necessarily cold, because there still would be very hot places.  But light and heat are just part of the lifeless background.

Then, within that are things that are best called animating agents or spirits.  The spirits are somehow separate from the universe.  They are special because they are able to move and manipulate things.  The material in the universe is dull, motionless, and dead, and all motion is caused by spirits.
