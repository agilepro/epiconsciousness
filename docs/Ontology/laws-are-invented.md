# Are Scientific Laws Invented or Discovered?

Don't mix up reality with our model of reality. It is a really important ontological distinction.

## What is a Law?

A scientific law is a DESCRIPTION of regularities in nature.  It is an unfortunate term calling it a law because it sound like something that someone dictated must happen, and perhaps the first scientists to use this term were thinking that these were things that God commanded.

This description is actually only an approximation.  It often simplifies things, and assumes that nothing else effects the result.  The law gives a result based on the idea that we can simplify the situation, and that side effects are minimal.   What reality does is different from this equation. 

Laws will be upgraded from time to time.  Newton wrote the law of gravity, and then Einstein wrote a different one.  The behavior of gravity certainly did not change between them.  Clearly the new law is a better approximation, but the facts laws can be made better gives us insight into what they are.

## What is Discovery?  What is Invention?

**Discovery** requires that the thing exist before someone thinks of it, while **invented** means it was created the first time it was thought of.  To be discovered, the law would have to exist in some form, before it occurred to the first person who thought of it.  The question is: did the scientific law exist before the first person thought to write it down?

I am not trying to quibble over the word "discovery" but I am trying to highlight the difference. We don't actually see nature as it is, but we invent models of nature and see that.

What we know of as "laws" are actually simplified models of the natural phenomena. They are approximate and for that reason NOT exactly what nature does, so we could not have discovered them in nature.

Once we have a law, we can describe nature in terms of that law.  We can talk about the stength of gravity on the surface of the earth, and know what that means. 

## Are there no Discoveries in Science?

Sure there are.  Mix hydrogen and oxygen, provide a spark, and a nice explosion results.  This is a real thing that actually happens.  Observations can be discoveries.  You get exactly the explosion you get.  These are regularities in nature.  They occur, we don't always know why they do, but we can observe them.

Then we abstract the law out of the observations.  We simplify.  We treat masses like point sources.  We assume there is no air resistence.  We assume that nothing else (like the spinning earth, or the magnetic field) have a significant effect.  Then we write a simple equation for the simplified situation.

It is important to note that nature never exactly matches the simplified situation, and therefor never does exactly what the law says.  The prediction though will be close enough to be usefu lfor our purposes.

To find the law, there is a search.  The scientist might propose many possible equations.  Then run experiements to see which one fits best.  It may take many iterations to find the right equation to represent the law.  I am sympathetic to those who would describe this as a method of discovery, and I don't want to quibble over the words.  

If we had access to what nature is actually doing, then we might look at that, write it down, and call it a discovery.  There is certainly a way that nature works.  The problem is that we can't really discover that directly.

## Example: Gravity

Take for instance the law of gravity: f = Gmm/rr 

This formula describes the behavior of objects in the universe in many certain circumstances.  It assumes that matter is point-like objects, and ignores relativistic effects.  This law is good enough to predict eclipses quite accurately.

Did this law exist out there to be discovered?  I think not, because this law precisely as stated does not actually exist in nature.  What nature does is different than this law, however the law is a good approximation in certain circumstances.  Because nature does not really "do" what the law says, it can't have come from nature.  Instead, it came from the mind of people and it was found to be a good enough model of what is happening.  The model is a fiction made up, but the model is good enough for our purpose.

Newton's law of gravity was a distinct expression in math. Later Einstein invented his law of gravity, and was found to be better. Gravity itself did not change behavior between the two. What Newton came up with was not what nature exactly does. Einstein's version is probably not exact either.
The exact behavior of nature is not the same thing as the "laws" we write down to describe nature. The laws are invented. They are an attempt to describe nature, but nature is distinct from the law.


So you are right: the laws (the models) are not the things discovered.
The real process is that a simplified formula is made up and tried and "fitted" to the observed phenomenon. There is some selection: not any formula will do, but it must be a formula that fits pretty well. As history goes on, we find better and better fits.
But this is the key point: we never ACTUALLY observe what nature does. We observe the models working. We use the model to make a prediction, and observe the outcome, and we then conclude that the law represents nature to some degree. But this is not what nature actually does.
It is a mistake, I think, to assume that nature is "doing" what the models say. You can never know what nature actually does, you can only make a model.


We don't have access to what nature really does.  In nature, everything affects everything.  There is no simplification.

The equation for the law of gravity was invented by Newton, and found to be approximately right.

If the model is a fiction, it could not have been discovered.  It must have been invented.

Discovery the act of trying many things, and then selecting the one that fits the data best. The important distinction is that in nature there is NOTHING that actually performs the calculation above. Nature evolves according to the Schroedinger equation, which looks exactly like Newtons law of gravity in many specific situations. The law of gravity is not actually what nature does, so it can't be discovered. It is an invention that is just an approximation. I can invent many approximations that are all approximation, and never the real thing.

It is an invention in exactly the same way that an award winning song is an invention: many many songs were tried, but only one won the award.

## Questions and Answers

> You roll marbles down an incline. You notice they go farther in the third second than they did in the second second, which was farther than it went in its first second. You have discovered that the relationship that describes this motion is a second power relationship.

The motion is described by `x = at^2`. This particular equation with those symbols: did they somehow appear floating over the rolling ball? Did the balls scratch this out into the surface.

There are two things to note. (1) the equation was invented, and (2) the equation is only approximate. In reality you need to worry about air resistance, Coriolis effects, and relativistic effects -- which are all small but cause a deviation from the ideal. The equation describes some ideal situation that does not exist in nature.

You are correct in that you keep trying possible equations until you get one that fits better than any other, so in that sense it is a discovery, but it seems there are two senses of discovery. In the philosophical sense, for something to be discovered, it would have to have been there BEFORE it was discovered. That equation (which is only approximate) was not there before Newton wrote it down. The equation was in this sense invented -- while at the same time the process of inventing and testing different equations is a kind of seeking the best fit.
