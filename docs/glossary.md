# Glossary

There are so many meanings of so many words it is hard to hold a conversation.  I will always adopt the meaning of a word that I believe is in most general use in the philosophy community.  My intention is to write in a way that is compatible with the bulk of the literature out there.  But that is unfortunately not always possible when there are multiple meanings of a word.

To clarify my writing, I offer this glossary of definitions to clarify which of various meanings I am intending when I use a words.  I hope to be consistent with these meanings when I write, however I am fallible and sometimes stray.  My apologies in advance.

## soul

By "soul" I mean your essential consciousness, the part of you that is aware that you exist. 

An immaterial soul/spirit would be able to persist after death of the material body, because it is not dependent upon in.  Soul is used in Christian literature to mean the part of you that continues on after death, and might then go to heaven or hell.

Such a situation was proposed by Rene Descartes where he assumes that the material world exists in one realm (res extensa), and consciousness/thinking/spirit exists in a separate realm (res cogitans). Thus your soul/spirit experiences the world without being part of the world. He felt that the spirit connected to the material world in the pineal gland of the brain, but he never found an explanation for how this happened.

Someone who believes in a soul separate from the body is a "dualist" because there are two aspects to the human experience.  Also called a Cartesian Dualist because of the connection with Descartes.

I am however a non-dualist, and I believe that every aspect of consciousness can be explained by workings of the material world.  I do not believe in an immaterial soul. Instead I think consciousness is a real process in the world.

## spirit

when speaking about spirit as an object, I mean exactly the same thing as soul.  Spirit and soul are interchangeable in my writing.
