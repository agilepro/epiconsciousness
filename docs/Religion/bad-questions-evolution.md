# Bad Questions about Evolution

## Peacock's Tail

 > your God (Darwin) who was made physically ill (his words, not mine) by the male peacock because: "Beauty created for its own sake . . . would be absolutely fatal to my theory."

Nobody thinks that Darwin is a God, and your saying so I assume you are trying to be humorous and so for amusement sake let that pass. Darwin was a person who wrote an important book, but he himself did not understand many important things about evolution -- we know so much more now.

About it making him ill: he was joking and if you read the rest of the article this becomes clear.  I don't seriously think that a peacock tail made him actually ill, and you don't either.  It is metaphorical, but what about.  Well, that detail is left out of the quote because it is quote mining.

That is because beauty is not created for its own sake. It is created to attract members of the opposite sex. The correspondence is about sexual selection. Sexual selection is an important part of evolutionary theory which you should try to understand. The flashier, more beautify peacock gets to mate with more peahens and therefor spread genes, which in turn makes more peacocks with the attributes of the father.
