# Mob Rule

<!--

Actually, I agree with this sentiment. 5 year olds do not think these things.
There is too much being made of sexuality of children, and I think there should be less of it, however getting the government involved to go after such parents is the wrong way. Nobody should be getting between a parent and their child. If that parent thinks from your and my point of view "wrong things" that is none of our business. God will take care of the child.
What is actually happening is that talk of people doing this is purposefully used to get people riled up. A leader promoting the idea that this evil is everywhere and "we gotta do something" is in reality just getting your emotions to make you do things to their wishes. Maybe they are just trying to get your vote. I don't know, but just be aware you are being manipulated.
Have a little more faith in god.

> They should when it's child abuse and that is child abuse.

Maybe you are convinced by the media that EVERYTHING about "trans" is a heinous child abuse, but you should be aware that media tend to focus exclusively on the most extreme examples, in order to get the read riled up, and spend more time on their site.
Certainly the government should ban child abuse, but we need a doctor -- or someone knowledgeable -- to be in there with the DETAILS and to be part of determining what is and is not child abuse. The problem with mob rule is that black-and-white decisions tend to ignore the real complications of the world.

> The "trans" issue has been propagandized and promoted. Parents are led to believe that allowing heinous procedures done to their children is the "right" thing to do because they can't see through the insidious bullsh*t. If it's not okay to allow parents to have their children's healthy limbs amputated, it's not okay to have their genitals amputated. It's severe child abuse.

I tend to agree with you. I would even include circumcision in the kind of mutilation we should not be doing.
There are doubtless some procedures that count as heinous, but the media get the most hits, the most activity, the most support when they report exclusively on the most extreme examples. It is simply not black and white.
Here is the problem: there are REAL issues that require intelligent consideration along with details that we have no access to. Therefor, non-thinking law enforced by big government might not be the best thing either.
It is important to deal with these kinds of things with knowledge, and with people who are actually experienced in the topic, and not by mobs who are fueled by extreme stories in the media.
That is why I say leave it to the parents and doctors, and form a healthy community around sharing the truth around whether a particular procedure counts as abuse or not. DETAILS MATTER.
