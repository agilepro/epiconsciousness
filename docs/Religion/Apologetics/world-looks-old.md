# Why Does World Look Old?

_Why do young earth creationists (YEC) think that god goes to such lengths to make the world look old._

It is certainly possible that god created the world last Thursday with all the history and all the appearance of being much older.  Creationism is like last-Thursdayism except it is 6000 years instead of 1 week.

With millions of fossils categorized, and thousands of layers of rock identified, there is no disagreement:  the world LOOKS exactly as if it was 4 billion years old and that life evolved slowly over that time laid down in rock layers that formed over 4 billion years.

Creationists: why do you believe god wants to deceive humanity?  Is it an elaborate joke on the non-believers?  Why would god make the world LOOK different than it really is?  Why does god need to fool the evolutionists with an elaborately detailed story will literally millions of facts pointing to a specific history?   Why must humans -- particularly those who spend the time to become expert -- be deceived in this way by God?

## Isle of Surtsea

_Ever heard of the [Isle of Surtsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtsey)? It is brand new, but some think it looks old._

This volcanic island off Iceland, was produced during an eruption covering the period November 1963 to June 1967.  Within a period of months this sterile, virgin rock was transformed into a ‘mature’ island with beaches, pebbles, sand, vegetation and many other features which would superficially suggest great geological age.  See [this article from creation.com](https://creation.com/surtsey-the-young-island-that-looks-old) that cites one person, Sigurdur Thorarinsson, a geologist, who found it hard to believe how the landscape had progressed.  This publication was not a geology paper, but in National Geographic and in a tourist book.

The fact is that it does NOT look old except in a superficial way that no geologist accepts.  When I say the Earth looks old, I mean that using the best geologic techniques, it really appears old, not that in some superficial wanna-be creationist way of squinting and saying it looks sorta like another island that is really old.

## No Evidence of Creation

Geologists know that the earth was formed through a series of processes that have been running for 4 billion years, and have not stopped running. Yes, the features on the earth continue forming, volcanoes continue to erupt, and plates continue to move. That is what it looks like and that is what it is.

There is absolutely no evidence that it was all created 6000 years ago and then creation stopped. The bible deceives everyone. I am just asking why God wants that deception in His name?

## Species and Layers

_How do you know the fossil record is not a record of variation of created species?_

The answer depends on which of all the various theories of creation we want to analyze, but lets consider the standard biblical YEC where the universe is create at one point in time (6000 years ago).  

In those layers, we find collections of life that lived together at the time that the layer was being created, and at no other time.  We always find the same group together in that rock, no matter where on Earth it is found. Then 99% of all species are extinct and they only appear in layers dated to long ago, and those species are not alive today. It makes absolutely no sense that Creation would cause fossils to be separated out cleanly into hundreds of well defined layers.

There is a weak argument that Noah's flood caused the layers.  But here is the thing:  floods don't cause hundreds of nice clean layers.  Floods churn everything up, and mix things quite thoroughly.  Have you ever seen a flood sort things out into nice categories.  Flowing water can sort some things by weight, however the fossils involves are both small and large, and they still are sorted together according to geological time and not according to size. 

## The Mud Problem

If the layers were all laid down by a flood, we know how long it takes mud to turn into stone.  Here is a [video explaining the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQcQSqH13xU).  A layer of clay 1 meter thick would take about 100,000 years to eliminate all the water, which is needed to turn into rock.  1000 meters of clay would take millions of years, far longer than 6000 years claimed by creationists.

## Mineral Age

There are many way to measure the age of a mineral. These are based one well known natural processes that run at a known rate. For example, nuclear decay happens at very accurately measured rates. Crystals will include an element based on its chemical properties, but after nuclear decay the chemical properties of the atom are changed which is how we know that the original crystal would not have formed with that element in there.

There are several dozen of these "clocks" that can be used to measure the age of minerals. We see minerals piled into layers at well defined ages. If the layers were made all at once, (in a flood for instance) they would all have the same age. That is not what we see.

It would be an extremely elaborate ruse for God to create all this at one point. Possible, but it would be fundamentally mendacious.
