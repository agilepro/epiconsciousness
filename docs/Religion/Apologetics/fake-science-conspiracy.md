# Science Conspiracy Trick

The creationist will argue that scientific results are reported only to align with the funding they receive.  The people controlling the funding are only funding research that produces false results, in order to oppress Christians.  


## Large Conspiracies Can Not Persist

The idea that grand conspiracies cannot remain secret for long periods of time stems from several key factors:

**Human Nature**: Large groups of people are prone to mistakes, leaks, and changes in loyalty. Over time, the likelihood that someone will reveal the conspiracy, intentionally or unintentionally, increases.

**Complexity and Scale**: The more complex and wide-reaching a conspiracy, the more difficult it is to manage and control all the variables. Coordinating actions, keeping everyone aligned, and maintaining the secrecy becomes exponentially harder.

**Whistleblowers and Defectors**: History has shown that individuals within organizations often come forward with information. As the number of people involved grows, so does the probability that someone will eventually speak out.

**Evidence and Documentation**: Large-scale conspiracies would likely generate substantial documentation and physical evidence. Keeping all such evidence concealed indefinitely is highly challenging.

**Media and Public Scrutiny**: In the age of digital communication and social media, information spreads rapidly. Investigative journalists, activists, and the general public are always on the lookout for inconsistencies and evidence of wrongdoing.

**Statistical Improbability**: Studies and statistical models suggest that the probability of a large conspiracy remaining hidden decreases dramatically over time. For example, physicist David Robert Grimes published a paper estimating that conspiracies involving large numbers of people would be exposed within a few years.

All these factors combined make it extremely unlikely for grand conspiracies to remain hidden for extended periods. While small-scale conspiracies can and do occur, the larger and more complex the conspiracy, the less feasible it is to maintain secrecy over the long term.

## Superstitious Thinking

Some Christians believe that these conspiracies are run by Satan who, being supernatural, can bring about supernatural effects, and possibly run a larger conspiracy than would be possible naturally.  

There really is nothing one can say to a person who believes in magic, that magic can not be used to bring about anything.  Those who believe that we are puppets manipulated by the gods are in fact hopelessly enthralled.

Anyone however that believe people are acting as people, temped by research grants from the devil, would have to explain why no record has been found of any tampering of this kind.  There would have to be a memo even if just to communicate to the NSA members containing the list of allowed experiments and research topics.  There would be some trace from the people doing the funding.

## Lack of Coordination

There is no evidence that the NSF and other funding agencies pay funding for specific results.  For example, funding in geology could never be targets such that the grant would be granted only if the results of a specific type were found.  For example, grants are not written on the condition that evidence of intelligent design is NOT found by the research, and somehow the real answer is covered up.  There is a level of coordination that is needed.

## Scientists Trick Themselves to Evade God

> "people who believe the fairytale of evolution want it to be true so they don't have to be held accountable to anyone above themselves. Thus making themselves their own god."

This person believes that evolution is invented by scientists in order to deny God and thereby delude themselves into believing they can escape God's instructions.

I can see that this explains to you the motivation for fabricating a false science.

At the same time you think these scientists are oblivious to the rather obvious problem that "pretending god does not exist" is not really going to get them out of any real trouble.  I am sure you agree that "pretending" God does not exist is not going to save you.  

It would be like jumping out of an airplane and thinking you are safe because you pretend that you have a parachute on.

These people are generally pretty smart, but you think that they make up an elaborate story of how life formed, and you think these smart scientists think this will make is so "they don't have to be held accountable to anyone"?  Let's just make this pretend stuff, and it will ACTUALLY work?

You think scientists are that dumb?  You propose that these scientists actually BELIEVE that God exists, but they construct an elaborate theory backed by millions of fossils so they can fool themselves into thinking God does not exist?  Surely there must be easier ways to simply fool yourself about God. Why not just hold your hands over your eyes?

This approach does not explain the millions of fossils that actually do exist, and are actually sorted meticulously into precise layers.  Denial of God or not, the evidence for evolution is overwhelming.  99% of all biologists agree that evolution is the best explanation for the variety of life on earth.
