## Evolution of the Eye

The evolution of the eye is one of the best understood evolutions of complex organs.  This is because eyes have evolved several times, and twice the process took a similar path and produced similar results. Yes, cephalopods have better eyes than vertebrates because they don't have our blind spot,  but we both ended up with fluid filled eyes with most of the same parts.

What helped us piece together eye evolution is the fact that there are organisms alive today that have examples of everything you see below. This means that each "step" in the evolution of eyes was also a destination.   Organisms with just a patch of light sensitive material are every bit as complete as those with an optical cup. They aren't fumbling around waiting for full eyes to form. Whatever stage of eye development their DNA produces,  that's what they use for the rest of their life. But if they have a mutation in the code for their optic cells, their descendants can be born with the next step.

Wikipedia has a decent treatment of the [Evolution of the eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye?fbclid=IwY2xjawIe6CNleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHcQdo9HRuj7GywBmJwVe7B68ziuv3K6lzlGFvtgJaDXagBlkOhQCvS-9yw_aem_SDgpUJtP-X0_C4aU3rRd1A).

## Books About the Eye

Here are some highly recommended books that delve into the evolution of the eye:

* "The Eye: A Natural History" by Simon Ings - This book explores the intricate world of vision, covering the evolution, anatomy, and capabilities of eyes.
* "The Mindâ€™s Eye" by Oliver Sacks - Sacks investigates the extraordinary abilities of the human mind in visual perception and the complexities of vision.
* "The Eye Book: A Complete Guide to Eye Disorders and Health" by Gary H. Cassel - A comprehensive guide to eye health, covering common disorders and preventive care.
* "Evolution's Witness: How Eyes Evolved" by Michael F. Land - This book provides a detailed account of the evolutionary history of eyes.
* "Eyes to See: The Evolution of Vision in Nature" by Andrew Parker - Parker discusses how vision has evolved across different species.
* "Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Visual System" by David Marr - A deep dive into the computational aspects of vision and its evolution.
* "The Evolution of Vision in Nature" by Andrew Parker - Parker explores the evolution of vision in various species and its impact on survival.
* "The Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin - While not solely focused on the eye, Darwin's seminal work discusses the broader principles of evolution that apply to the eye.
* "The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution" by Richard Dawkins - Dawkins' book touches on the evolution of various traits, including vision.
* "The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design" by Richard Dawkins - Dawkins explains how natural selection can lead to complex structures like the eye.

These books should provide a comprehensive understanding of how the eye has evolved over time. Happy reading!
