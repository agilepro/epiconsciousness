# Science Denialism

## Words from St Augustine

> “Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking non-sense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an **embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn**.

> “The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of the faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason?

> “Reckless and incompetent expounders of holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although “they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion."

## No Evidence of Evolution Trick

> The problem is some parts of evolution are true, supported by science and sound evidence. And other parts are conjecture, wishful imagination, with ZERO evidence. Microevolution is seen everyday, but macroevolution is unsupported by direct concrete evidence. Macroevolution is nothing but wishful thinking, cartoon drawings, and good artwork. No evidence because there is none.

If you saw a photograph of a burglar entering a store at night, and more photos of them carrying out stolen goods, you would have evidence of a burglary, right?

"Observation" does not mean you were in the room with the burglar. A reliable photo is good enough, right? Even though there is no picture of them actually picking up the goods, we see them in a position of walking out with them is good enough, right?

We have such photos in the form of fossils. It is an impression of the hard parts of an animal preserved in rock.  That is as concrete as you can get.  There are reliable ways to date the rocks. These are essentially photographs of life as it was long ago.

Why do you not consider this to be evidence?
