# Just a Theory

Apologists will often slip in the statement that evolution is just a theory as if by theory they mean that it is somehow untrue.  They are playing on a common misunderstanding of the meaning.  In common parlance a theory might mean something very speculative, but in science a theory has a very specific meaning, and it is not that 

:::tip[Key Takeaway]

A theory is the best and strongest outcome of science.  Some theories are well supported and accepted as fact, others are new are somewhat speculative.  Theories don't change into laws when accepted.

## What is a Theory?

A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world.

A scientific theory is a tested and expanded hypothesis that explains many experiments. It fits ideas together in a framework. If anyone finds a case where all or part of a scientific theory is false, then that theory is either changed or thrown out.

Scientific theories are testable and make verifiable predictions. They describe the causes of a particular natural phenomenon and are used to explain and predict aspects of the physical universe or specific areas of inquiry (for example, electricity, chemistry, and astronomy). As with other forms of scientific knowledge, scientific theories are both deductive and inductive, aiming for predictive and explanatory power. Scientists use theories to further scientific knowledge, as well as to facilitate advances in technology or medicine.

## Examples of Theories

Plate tectonic theory successfully explains numerous observations about the Earth, including the distribution of earthquakes, mountains, continents, and oceans.

Theory of Gravity explains the orbits of planets and galaxies, as well as how things fall down on a planet.  It predicts the path of a projectile.

String Theory is an example of a theory which has not actually produced a prediction on its own, and so remains a speculative theory.

## Other Terms

**Scientific Fact** - is a particular observation.  For example, on some date it was raining in some particular place.  Or an eclipse occurred on April 8.  Facts are just data, measurements of a particular thing.

**Scientific Law** - is an observed relationship.  If you drop something, it falls down.  This can be observed regularly.  A law does not attempt to explain the regularity, it just cites it as something that regularly happens.

**Hypothesis** - a specific proposal around what will happen in certain conditions.  It represents the expectation, due either to a law or a theory.  it is testable, and usually produced in order to support a test.  A hypothesis does not explain the result, it simply states what should occur without saying why.

These don't ever "turn into" each other.  A fact would never become a law, and a law never becomes a theory, however given some facts, one might see a law that leads to a theory about why the law exists.
