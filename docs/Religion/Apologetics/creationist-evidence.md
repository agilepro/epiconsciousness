# Creationism

Here we examine the theory of Genesis presented in the bible book with that name.  The Theory of Genesis is that God appears and creates all plants and animals in their final form, and all those animals are in essentially the same form today.  Some changes like breeding of dogs and cows is allowed, but no kind ever is directly related to any other kind.  

Creationism is directly opposed to evolution because it denies the most central idea of evolution: that animals change slowly over long periods of time, and that all animals are related to each other.

## No Evidence

> Atheists the joke of demanding evidence is up. We know that no matter what creationists present, it will be rejected

Because creationists don't have any evidence.  Evidence must be "demonstratable" which means anyone can have access to it. An example of "evidence" is the sun, moon, and stars can be observed by anyone on earth, no special access needed.

Hearsay written in a book -- any book -- is not evidence.

The problem is that when you present something that is NOT demonstratable and not objectively accessible by everyone, then it is not evidence.

The millions of fossils that support evolution are all accessible to anyone.  There a museums where you can go see them yourself, or you can go dig in the rocks and verify that everything about them is the way the paleontologist says.  That is evidence.

But none of the fossils support the theory of Genesis.  Genesis can't explain why there are distinct layers with distinct fossils in them.  That is a big problem.

So, yes, creationism has an evidence problem.

What is the definition of "evidence".  It has to be something that any number of people could look at, examining, and further similar examples would be found in the world by anyone.

For example, when proving the earth goes around the sun, anyone can track the positions of the stars and with a little math come to the same conclusion.
Evidence is not just be a story written in an old book. It is not a strongly worded opinion that someone might have. Evidence is not a coincidence that something happened once and the odds seem large. Evidence has to be readily repeatable.

Do creationists have any evidence for their beliefs which are readily available to everyone at any time?

## Not Showing It

> I have evidence, but there is no point in showing it because you won't believe it anyway.

If someone says this, it really means they don't have any evidence, but they don't want to admit it.  Being evasive and reliant on obfuscation is an admission of a fear of scrutiny. Its an emotional investment rather than a belief as a result of an organic conclusion.

## Intuition

What is claimed by creationists to be evidence is nothing more than an intuitive estimation of what is likely (to them) to be the best explanation for the available information, while also reducing and or minimizing the likelihood of other potential explanations.  That is, information that they find _convincing_ and _credible_ is put forward as evidence.

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what evidence is: evidence must be an observation that anyone could do.  I can observe a trilobite along with the rock layer it is in and all the other fossils in that layer.  The evidence is the fossil of the trilobite, not the explanation give for why that fossil formed.  Creationists have nothing to show that can be directly observed in any way.

## Falsifiability

The creationist idea that a God came, waved a wand, and poofed everything into existence would not leave any trace of that action.  Just suddenly the world would be different with nothing in nature causing it.  There would be no record of that creation, and therefor no way to falsify it.  

What young earth creationists (YEC) don't explain is why 99% of all species are extinct.  God apparently creates millions of fossils for creatures that never actually existed.  God makes it _look_ like millions of years of history, but that is all just to fool us.  The creationist has to explain why God has gone to such great lengths to fool us, even though the bible says God would never do anything like that.

There is another kind of creationist known as intelligent design (ID) where the earth is really old, and all those other prior species existed, it is just the God had a hand in the nudging course of evolution along the way.  Unfortunately again no evidence for the nudge; only their intuition that it must be necessary.

 Creationism remains due to its lack of falsifiability by design in addition to heavy emotional, societal, financial investment, and legislative enforcement. The claims themselves are generally intentionally designed to be unfalsifiable erroneously working on the assumption that being a strength of the argument by the proponents. Not realizing that a concept that is proposed to explain everything, explains nothing.
