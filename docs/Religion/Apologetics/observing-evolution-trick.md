# Evolution Never Observed Trick

Evolution deniers will say that evolution has never been observed.  They will claim that "micro evolution" exist to explain how lines of animals tend to adapt to situation and to see the kinds of change that we have seen in animals in a couple thousand years (or less).  But "macro evolution" has never been observed to produce a new species.

To accomplish this trick they need the listener to accept a very narrow view of what "observe" means.  Sometimes they say observed in the lab.  It means that a person saw the line of animals before it changed into a new species, and a person saw it after.

They know full well that large changes take a long time, around a million years to see significant change.  We know how fast DNA can drift on the average, and we know how different the DNA is in different species, and we can estimate how long it would take under optimal conditions.  

It is dishonest to say that looking for 2000 years "proves" a millions years can not produce this change.  That is like waiting from midnight to 12:05 and claiming that there is no such thing as a sunrise.

The fact is that one CAN observe longer periods by looking at the fossil record.  Each fossil is like a photograph at a point in time.  If you look at the photographs of a crime, for example the security footage, from that series of photos you can have a good understand of what must have happened.  They act as is if photographs don't count for observation: you have to have a human sitting there or else it was not observed.

They they make the further assumption that if it was not observed, it could not have happened.  This would be like seeing a person start a marathon, and then watch them end, and claiming that they did not exist between the start and end.  

Also, they don't extrapolate from known causes.  We know that animals can change at a certain rate when being bred for a particular trait or two, and one can easily assume that wait 100 times as long, and you should be able to see 100 times as much change.  That is like saying that you have seen a person walk across the room, but nobody has ever seen a person walk 500 miles.  Is is just not possible because you didn't directly watch the whole thing.

All this logic is nonsense, but it is what their audience wants to hear, so it is greedily lapped up.

## Changing Kinds

Why can't an animal of one kind change into an animal of another kind?  The only difference is the DNA.  The basic material is the same: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen.  The organic chemistry founded on molecules consisting of chains of carbon atoms are the same for all life on earth.  

It would seem that evolution deniers believe in a kind of "essence" which each kind of animal has.  dog has essence of dog.  Cats have essence of cat.  Wolves have essence of wolf.  A wolf can't evolve into a dog because where would the essence of wolf go?  And where did the essence of dog come from.

This is magical thinking.  Sure dogs and cats look different, but that difference is purely in the genes.  Take a dog egg and put cat genes in, and fertilize with cat sperm and you get a cat.  There simply is no different except the DNA is written a little differently.
