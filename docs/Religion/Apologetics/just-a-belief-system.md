# Science just Belief System?

> Q: _Both Science and Christianity are just belief systems._

Only people who don't understand science say that.

The key idea of science is that you must reject your intuition and reject your beliefs, and you must **demonstrate** evidence of what you claim. If you have no evidence, then keep quite. Only claims that can be demonstrated are allowed. That is the difference between science and theism.

> Q: _Science is just the study of creation, like theism_

Science is exactly what you say: study of the creation. But it differs from religion in that you must actually demonstrate what you claim in a way that can be reproduced. No scientist is ever asked to _believe_ another scientist, they are instead provided with evidence that demonstrates the claim.

## Christian Confidence

> Q: _Christians know they are right._

It is the "pride of the christian" to be so self assured about their view of the world. This pride fills them with unreasonable confidence that they simply can't be wrong. It is arrogance.  The "pride of the christian" is also the "hubris of christianity" because it prevents them from being humble, and so they over extend their claim, are wrong, and yet never notice it.

A scientist must accept that even the best theory _might_ be wrong.  Every scientist is actively searching for experimental results that violate a theory, because such results lead to new and important discoveries.  It is the opposite of blasphemy:  experimental results contrary to the doctrine are celebrated and more likely to be published than otherwise.

It is surprising that so many Christians don't understand the competitive nature of science.  Any scientist would **love** to find experimental results that call another theory into question.  Such a result can do more for the career of a scientist than any experiment that confirmed a theory.

## Insecurity in Beliefs

Christians are so insecure that when you call god a "sky daddy" they get offended. That is because they have no real foundation to their belief beyond the writings of people in an ancient book.  They have no solid evidence that what they say is true.  Instead, they require faith from the believer.

Science is different. You can mock gravity and evolution all you want, but everything is backed by solid evidence. If you claim that the Earth's orbit not caused by gravity from the Sun, you have to come up with some evidence that would show gravity to be false.  The ability to claculate the precise time and location of an ecplise is evidence that orbits work exactly as predicted byt he theory of gravity.  Scientists have so much evidence that they are not worried of being shown to be wrong.  No amount of name calling can make me stop believing in quantum mechanics.
