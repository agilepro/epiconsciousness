# Arguments to Avoid with Creationists

Here I collect bad arguments which I have seen people use in an effort to convince science deniers.  These arguments are not good, because they fail in most cases to address the issue that the science denier hold, or else present in a way that gets interpreted incorrectly.

## Common Features Implies Evolution

The argument is this:  Many different species have the same arrangement of parts, and in some cases we will find the same flaw in many species, and this means that they must be inherited, thereby providing evidence that evolution is true.  For example the basic brain structure of brain, or the structure of the eye.  The argument is that because all mammals have mostly the same internal organs, they must have been inherited.  Some post the question: if all these feature are the same, how could this be the result of creation.
