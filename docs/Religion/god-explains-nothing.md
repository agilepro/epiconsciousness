# God Explains Nothing

In this section we consider the theory that things occurred in the history of the universe because God made them happen.  When we agree that something like the big bang or the formation of the stars actually did occur, then what addition explanation do we get from by saying that God did it?

:::tip [Key Takeaway]

The theory that god made things happen explains nothing about how those things actually happen.  It is just more familiar and comforting to think that some person was behind it, and it makes the universe seem more like our experienced lives in our homes.

## The Question

Posted to an anti-atheist group was the follow question about five key events in the history of the universe.  The original was phrased in a snarky way as strawman arguments to blow over more easily, but I won't reproduce that here.  Below are the five arguments presented in a polite rational way:

* ONE: The big bang.  How can this occur when there is nothing and result in a complete universe?
* TWO: The formation of stars.  How can the floating matter of the universe come together and then ignite the stars and galaxies and planets?
* THREE: The origin of life.  How can life come from non life?
* FOUR: The diversity of life.  How can mutation and natural selection cause new species to form from older species?
* FIVE: Mind.  How can the first mind form when there was no mind before it?

> Christians believe in miracles with an adequate cause (God).  Atheists believe in miracles without an adequate cause (magic).

## The Answer

We agree I believe that all these things occurred.  The big bang is NOT anything like an "explosion" and so your intuition around what explosions can do are off, but setting that aside both sides agree that the big bang happened.

Theists and atheists agree that the big bang happened.  They agree that stars formed.  They agree that at some point life started when there was no other life in the universe.  They both agree that millions of different species formed from the original one. And finally we agree that a there was a point in time when the first mind was formed.

Both atheists and theists agree that these amazing and unbelievable things actually happened.  The difference is only that the theist looks around their personal life and says: I have never seen anything like any of these happen to me at home in my house.  I have never seen it happen so it can't happen except if there is a human-like animator in the sky who then waves a wand to "make it happen".  The miracle of the beginning of life is exactly just as miraculous, but theists feel more comfortable saying that person-like entity decided to make it happen.  Because in the theist home experience, changes like this only happen when a person does them.

What the theist does is takes their home experience, and says that the universe has to be just like what they experience at home.

How did god make the big bang?  We don't know.  It is the same miracle whether god did it or not.  It is just that theists are more comfortable imagining that a person-like figure made it happen.  Because that would be more like their own life.

There is no reason to believe that the starting of any of these things is any more miraculous or any less miraculous just because you imagine a person-like entity "making it happen"
