#  Question About Sin

Gabriel: what are all those piles of tickets?

God: speeding tickets. Humans keep speeding.

Gabriel: Is that dangerous?

God: well, not really. I set the speed limit to 5 MPH. People are trying to drive under 5 MPH but try as they might, they just can’t, and huge mounds of speeding tickets are piling up.

Gabriel: How do people feel about this?

God: Some people do not care, so they sometimes speed. Some people like to speed, and they do it a lot! Most people try to drive at a reasonable speed, which is still often too fast. Either way, it shows that every person is a bad driver, since a person either will not, or cannot, drive under 5 MPH. That makes some of them feel terrible, like feeling they are inherently evil.

Gabriel: So what is the solution?

God: I am reconsidering. After a bit of contemplation I think maybe that is a bit too strict. But I have a plan to solve the problem.

Gabriel: what are you going to do?

God: Well, it starts by getting a virgin pregnant …. but don’t worry about the details, it is a little complicated, but in the end I will solve the problem. Any human who will believe in me, will have all the tickets canceled. Complete forgiveness.

Gabriel: So no more tickets?

God: No, they still get the tickets, and they still have to come into traffic court, but since 5 MPH is not really very fast, and because I love them so I can forgive them. This sorts it all out neatly.

Gabriel: But there will still be piles of tickets?

God: yes. Speeding is still illegal, it is just that there is no punishment for speeding.

Gabriel: why don’t you just revoke the speed limit law?
