# Humans are Special?

_A post in the "How to convert an atheist to Christianity" series._

:::tip[Never Say . . .]

Don't argue that the universe was created for humans because we are special.  A universe created for humans would be a lot more hospitable to humans.

## What Evidence?

_What would a universe that was built just for people look like?_

The universe is incredibly big, and 99.9999% of the universe is lethal to humans.  The fact is that the surface of the earth is a very very tiny part of the universe, and not very typical at all.  Earth's atmosphere is an incredibly tiny part of the universe that we can survive in.  If the universe was created just for us, why would it be so huge and so lethal?

It would be like the rat thinking that the sewer was created just for it.

An atheist will not find it credible that incredibly large lethal universe was created for the purpose of a 0.000001 part of it habitable by humans.  

## God Wants Worship?

The atheist is likely to ask how it can be that god created the entire universe in order to create a population of people for no other purpose than to worship himself? that does not strike you as a bit "needy"?

> Does a man wanting sons make him needy?

I would never want my sons to worship me. I would strive to make them better than me, and not just fawning over me and praising me for cancelling a rule that I created in the first place.

> But you want them to love you, dont you? And obey you?

Not really. I would like them to do the right thing, and to improve the world for everyone. But to build churches in my name, and then kill people who disagree with them about me?  No I would never want that. I would never want them to write a petty book when they are very primitive, and then force people to defend primitive beliefs (and obviously incorrect beliefs) for no other reason than the book is 2000 years old? I would never want that. I can't help thinking that it would take an incredible megalomaniac to do all that.

I do feel so sorry for people that are deep within the thrall of a religions that is so outdated.
God writes his message on the fabric of the universe, there for everyone to see. God created the universe to continually transcend itself, not to follow writings of 2000 year old men who thought that wearing mixed cloth was a sin. A real God would teach the beings of the universe to find his work in the universe itself, and not be deluded by others who had ulterior motives 2000 years ago. This is clear to anyone who can free themselves from the dogma of religion.
