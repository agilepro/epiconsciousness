# Poor Madeline

This page talks about the logic consequences of (1) an omnipotent God having an (2) and important message to give out, and (3) using an unreliable means to convey that message.

:::tip [Key Takeaway]

If God has an important message, it will be delivered to each of us individually.  Human messengers might be part of that, but not a necessary part.

:::

I have written about how an unreliable means such as written testimony is certainly not the way an omniscient and omnipotent God would spread a message.  Relying on humans to convey the messages us error prone.  why use an error prone mechanism?  It doesn't make sense.

## Madeline Needs Saving

The assumptions we are making is that God has an important message to give to Madeline.  Without this message, Madeline will spend eternity in hell, but if she gets the message she will spend eternity in heaven.  So it is a big difference.

God has decided that Bob should convey the message to Maddy.  Bob is an upstanding member of the church and Bob has conveyed the message of faith to others before.  Unfortunately, Bob screws up and fails to tell Maddy.  Bob was supposed to take the train and meet Maddy, let he know the good news, but he overslept, missed the train, and now Maddy is destined for an afterlife in hell.
