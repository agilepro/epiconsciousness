# Free Will

On this page I will explain why free will as it is normally defined is nonsense.  To do so I need to delve into the precise definition of it, and the definition of libertarian freedom.  I will show that it makes no sense, and that we would not want free will if we had it.  

While the opposite of free will appears to be very undesirable, that is a misunderstanding of how emergence works to give us control without being free in a libertarian sense.  Instead of free will, we have `self will` which is determined, but it is determined by ourselves.  Self will is what we actually want, because we want to be able to determine what we do, not just to act free from any constraints.  Self will is compatible with determinism.

:::tip [Key Takeaway]

Free will as it is properly defined by philosophy is nonsense because nothing is ever completely _free_.  We don't need or desire that kind of freedom.  What we have and want is `self will` where we determine what we do.

## Definition of Free Will

> Free will is "The power of making choices that are neither determined by natural causality nor predestined by fate or divine will."  - [American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=free%20will)

> Free will is the "freedom of humans to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention" - [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/free%20will)

> "Libertarian free will is the philosophical view that individuals have the capacity to make choices that are not determined by prior events or causal laws, allowing for genuine alternative possibilities in decision-making." - [Libertarian Free Will Explained](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/libertarian-free-will-explained)

Each of these definitions describes an action that is done, and that action is described as a choice.  That is, there are potentially two or more actions, and one ultimately obtains.  The discussion usually focusses on the relationship to a **cause**, and particularly that there is _no cause_ to the action.  It is "free" from causation, which sets it directly contrary to determinism, the idea that everything is caused.  We need to understand what causation is.



## Uncaused means random

If something is not caused, then it is ontologically random.  If something is uncaused then it could happen equally at any moment and at any place.  The cause is the reason that something happens at a particular time and place.  The ball flying through the window is the reason that the glass breaks.  If the glass breakage was uncaused, then it could break at any time without any association with any other event in the universe.

> We may define a cause to be an object, followed by another, and where all the objects similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second. - David Hume
