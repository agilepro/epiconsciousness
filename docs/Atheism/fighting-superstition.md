# Fighting Superstition

This page is only for people who want defend the world against crazy superstitions and myths that are actively propagated by religions of the world.


## Written by People

Always remember that the bible was written by people.  The things in the bible are things that ancient people said.  They claimed it was from God, but we have no actual evidence of this. Prophesy was supposed to be the way that the true prophet could be distinguished from the false, but when the story includes both the prediction and the satisfaction, without any independent verification, and when predicted in such a vague way that almost anything can satisfy it, then prophesy is not convincing.

All religions claim that their myths are from god.  All religions claim that they have the one true and correct story.  This is the special pleading fallacy.

Never say "God said ..." when speaking of writings in the bible.  That is admission that god exists.  Instead, always say "The writers of the bible said ..."   

## Don't Deny God

God might or might not exist, and the form of god might be completely unknown.  Remember that Einstein endorsed "Spinoza's God" which is in fact the same thing as the universe.  God in this case is simply the "logic of the universe" and that logic clearly exists, whether or not it was created by intelligence.

Instead, mention a specific god.  Jesus is a particular superstition described in the bible which can be denied.  Yahweh is another name for the biblical god.  Zeus and Odin are good gods to call out as not existing, and you will get a lot of agreement.

Science has not really solved the problem of why the universe exists.  There is almost certainly a reason, and whatever brought about the universe will ultimately be called god.  This is not a battle to fight.

Instead, be specific.  It is the superstitions of the bible that are causing the problem.
